===================================

*News homepages, human rights scores, commercial zones, national park species, and Australia shipwrecks.*


__News homepages, archived.__ Since launching in March 2022, [homepages.news](https://homepages.news/) has [archived millions](https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/status-report.html) of screenshots, performance audits, [robots.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt) files, accessibility trees, and hyperlink lists from the homepages of [1,100+ news sites](https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/sources.html). The [open-source](https://github.com/palewire/news-homepages/) project, run by journalist [Ben Welsh](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/), provides [bulk data for each of those assets](https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/extracts.html). The screenshots themselves are [stored on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/news-homepages); you can also [view the latest screenshots from all the sites on one page](https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/latest.html). To date, the publications span [32 countries](https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/countries.html) and [17 languages](https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/languages.html). __Related__: Welsh and [volunteer Alex Garcia](https://mastodon.palewi.re/@palewire/111046697091347911) are using the [robots.txt data](https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/extracts.html#robotstxt-sample-csv) to track [which sites block OpenAI, Google AI, and Common Crawl](https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/openai-gptbot-robotstxt.html) — findings that [have](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/can-journalism-survive-ai/) [been](https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders) [cited](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/how-many-news-websites-block-ai-crawlers) [widely](https://mastodon.palewi.re/@palewire/111663536216388030).


__Human rights scores.__ The [CIRIGHTS](https://cirights.com/) project [aims](https://cirights.com/learn-about-the-cirights-project/) “to create numerical measures for every internationally recognized human right for all countries of the world.” The team has developed a [detailed guide](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4625036) to scoring each government’s record on [dozens of such rights](https://cirights.com/rights-we-score/), such as freedom of religion, women’s political rights, freedom from extrajudicial killings, the right to a fair trial, and “reasonable limits” on working hours. For each year from 1981 to 2021, the project’s scorers have rated each country on each right, generally on a three-point scale, based on information in the US State Department’s [Country Reports on Human Rights Practices](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/), [Amnesty International’s annual reports](https://www.amnesty.org/en/annual-report-archive/), and similar sources. The resulting dataset includes those scores, as well as several summary metrics.


__Commercial zones.__ [Byeonghwa Jeong et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03275-3) have constructed a [dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Commercial_Boundary/24654309/4) estimating the geographic boundaries of 23,000+ commercial zones in 69 metro areas in the US and Canada. To build it, they [used data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03275-3/tables/1) on retail and office locations from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), and on job density from the US Census Bureau’s [Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/) ([DIP 2021.05.26](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-05-26-edition/)) and [Statistics Canada](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dt-td/Index-eng.cfm?APATH=3&FL=A). For each detected commercial zone, the dataset provides its outline, total area, a score of its relative concentration (on which the zone comprising most of Manhattan scored the highest), its [MSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area), and the street at its centroid.


__National park species.__ The National Park Service’s [NPSpecies portal](https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/) “documents our knowledge about the occurrence and status of species” on the agency’s lands. For each NPS-managed area, you can download a list of the species, their scientific and common names, occurrence status (present, probably present, unconfirmed), nativeness, conservation status, and more. __Related__: Noting that “many of the observations in NPSpecies remain unverified and the lists are often outdated,” [Benjamin J. LaFrance et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02836-2) have created an [updated dataset for amphibian species](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2301647), which they checked against other sources and verified with regional experts.


__Australia shipwrecks.__ The [Western Australia Museum](https://data.museum.wa.gov.au/) hosts a [range of datasets](https://data.museum.wa.gov.au/search/type/dataset), including details concerning [1,600+ local shipwrecks and 30,000+ artifacts recovered from them](https://data.museum.wa.gov.au/dataset/maritime-archaeology). The shipwreck dataset lists each ship’s builder, construction materials, owner, cargo, wreck location, date wrecked, known deaths, date found, and more. __Previously__: [Ancient shipwrecks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11fk5YeQ4eFOnYSBNpUdHp4TP42gJ7wY5/edit?gid=970169931#gid=970169931) ([DIP 2024.07.10](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2024-07-10-edition/)).
