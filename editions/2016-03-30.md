Data Is Plural — 2016.03.30 edition
===================================

*Drone permits, black markets, Titanic passengers, food facts, and the “natural amenities scale.”*

&nbsp;

**U.S. drone permits.** Want to fly a drone in the United States for non-recreational purposes? You’ll need a “Section 333” exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration, which governs drone activity. The FAA [publishes a list of approved exemptions](https://www.faa.gov/uas/legislative_programs/section_333/333_authorizations/), which Bard College’s [Center for the Study of the Drone](http://dronecenter.bard.edu/) has converted into a [PDF-formatted database](http://dronecenter.bard.edu/analysis-us-drone-exemptions-14-15-2/). *The Verge*, in turn, has converted that PDF into [an easy-to-use CSV](https://github.com/voxmedia/data-projects/tree/master/verge-drones-over-america). **Related:** Last week, the FAA updated its [dataset of unmanned aircraft sightings](http://www.faa.gov/uas/law_enforcement/uas_sighting_reports/).

**Digital black markets.** Researcher Gwern Branwen has assembled [an archive of listings posted to “dark net markets"](http://www.gwern.net/Black-market%20archives). *Silk Road* is the best-known among the group, but the collection covers scores of other markets, including *Amazon Dark and FreeBay*. The materials gathered from each site are slightly different; many include product advertisements and seller profiles. Warning: Some of the archives contain pictures, which may include offensive or disturbing imagery. And it’s probably wise to heed Gwern’s caveats: The scrapes “are large, complicated, redundant, and highly error-prone. They cannot be taken at face-value.” [h/t [Mike Sconzo](http://www.secrepo.com/)]

&nbsp;

**Titanic passengers.** Based in large part on [Encyclopedia Titanica](http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/), researchers have compiled a structured dataset of [1,309 passengers on the *RMS Titanic*’s maiden voyage](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic.html). (To get the data, download *titanic3.csv* [on this page](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets).) The dataset includes passengers’ names, ages, ticket fare, cabin number, and whether they survived.

&nbsp;

**Groceries, quantified.** [Open Food Facts](http://world.openfoodfacts.org) is a crowdsourced database of food products’ nutrition data and ingredient lists. (E.g., [this kilogram jar of Nutella](http://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/3017620401473/nutella-1kg-ferrero) contains 316 grams of fat.) The [entire database can be downloaded](http://world.openfoodfacts.org/data) in several formats.

&nbsp;

**America, the varyingly beautiful.** In 1999, the USDA Economic Research Service published a “[natural amenities scale](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/natural-amenities-scale.aspx),” which rated every county in the contiguous United States based on factors such as landscape variation and January sunniness. Last year, based on the dataset, a *Washington Post* reporter called Minnesota’s Red Lake County “[the absolute worst place to live in America](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/17/every-county-in-america-ranked-by-natural-beauty/).” [Now, he’s moving there](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/08/why-im-moving-to-the-place-i-called-americas-worst-place-to-live/).

*Clarification: The previous edition of Data Is Plural featured a dataset of “UK” / “British” property sales, but the dataset covered only England and Wales — not Scotland or Northern Ireland. Confused about the difference(s)? See [this Venn diagram](http://qntm.org/uk) or [this five-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNu8XDBSn10).
