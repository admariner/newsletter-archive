Data Is Plural — 2019.08.21 edition
===================================

*Oil and gas, historical terrorist groups, TV news words, UK general elections, and confidence.*


__Oil and gas.__ The [Joint Organisations Data Initiative](https://www.jodidata.org/about-jodi/history.aspx) (JODI) coordinates the collection, standardization, and publication of oil and gas data from around the world; the 100+ countries that participate represent the vast majority of global production. The [oil data](https://www.jodidata.org/about-jodi/jodi-world-databases.aspx) goes back to 2002; the [gas data](https://www.jodidata.org/gas/database/data-downloads.aspx) goes back to 2009. Both datasets are updated monthly and track a range of subproducts (e.g., crude oil, diesel, jet fuel) and flows (e.g., imports, exports, production) for each country. __Previously:__ [Global and gas infrastructure](https://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/global-oil-gas-features-database) ([DIP 2018.06.06](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2018-06-06-edition)) and [state-owned oil companies](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-05-01-edition) ([DIP 2019.05.01](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-05-01-edition)).


__Historical terrorist groups.__ [Joshua Tschantret](https://jtschantret.com/), a political science Ph.D. candidate at the University of Iowa, has compiled a dataset of [260+ terrorist groups formed between 1860 and 1969](https://jtschantret.com/data/). For the purposes of the dataset, “terrorist groups are operationally defined as politically-motivated non-state actors using *bombings* or *assassinations*,” Tschantret writes in [an introductory article](https://jtschantret.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/the-old-terrorism-a-dataset-1860-1969.pdf) (PDF). About one-third of the groups in the dataset operated in the US, Russia, or China; the rest are spread across dozens of other countries. __Related:__ [Additional documentation](https://jtschantret.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/online-appendix.pdf) (PDF). __Good to know:__ On Twitter, [Tschantret explains why the Black Panthers are included](https://twitter.com/jtschantret/status/1161171198841151489).

__A decade of TV news words.__ The [TV-NGRAM](https://blog.gdeltproject.org/announcing-the-television-news-ngram-datasets-tv-ngram/) project pulls 14 TV stations’ data from the [Television News Archive](https://archive.org/details/tv) and calculates how often each word (and two-word combination) was said during each 30-minute window. Most of the stations’ counts go back 9 or 10 years, and all are updated daily.


__A century of UK general elections.__ On Monday, the British government published a [dataset of voting results](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8647), by party and parliamentary constituency, for every UK general election since 1918 — merging modern data with a handful of historical sources.


__Confidence.__ [The Confidence Database](https://osf.io/s46pr/) is aggregating [data from behavioral studies](https://psyarxiv.com/h8tju) that have asked participants’ how confident they were in their own assessments. As of its launch earlier this month, the database contains 145 datasets, 8,700 participants, and 4 million individual observations.
