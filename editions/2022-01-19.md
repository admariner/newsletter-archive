*Political emails, foreign commerce interventions, commuting zones, tech support scams, and Wordle words.*


__More political emails.__ [Derek Willis](https://twitter.com/derekwillis), a [journalism lecturer](https://merrill.umd.edu/directory/derek-willis) with an expertise in political data, [has published](https://createsend.com/t/t-97F63A7D578A8F0B2540EF23F30FEDED) a searchable, downloadable [database of 100,000+ email messages](https://political-emails.herokuapp.com/) received in recent years by an address he created for this purpose, and “which I routinely plug into forms I find on candidate and committee sites.” The database, which Willis [plans to update weekly](https://twitter.com/derekwillis/status/1480657382703312901), lists each message’s timestamp, sender, subject line, and body. __Previously__: [The Princeton Corpus of Political Emails](https://electionemails2020.org/) ([DIP 2021.06.23](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-06-23-edition/)), [the Markup’s collection of 5,000+ campaign emails](https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-wheres-my-email) ([DIP 2020.03.04](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-03-04-edition/), and [DCInbox’s congressional e-newsletter collection](https://www.dcinbox.com/) ([DIP 2021.03.03](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-03-03-edition/)).

__Foreign commerce interventions.__ The [Global Trade Alert](https://www.globaltradealert.org/), [launched in 2009](https://www.globaltradealert.org/about), “provides timely information on state interventions taken since November 2008 that are likely to affect foreign commerce,” such as new subsidies, export quotas, import tariffs, or anti-dumping laws. Its [downloadable dataset](https://www.globaltradealert.org/data_extraction) describes 33,000+ interventions, listing their types, implementing jurisdictions, affected jurisdictions, affected products, and more. The project, [affiliated with the University of St. Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/wissen/newsroom/aktuell/rssnews/forschung-lehre/2020/november/stgallen-endowment-for-prosperity-through-trade-26november2020), has also started tracking [interventions that affect digital commerce](https://www.globaltradealert.org/digital_policy).

__Commuting zones.__ Decades ago, the USDA [Economic Research Service](https://www.ers.usda.gov/) developed a methodology to group the nation’s counties into hundreds of “[commuting zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting_zone),” based on the Census’s [journey to work](https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/commuting.html) data. Those groupings are available [from the agency](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commuting-zones-and-labor-market-areas/) (for 1980, 1990, and 2000), and [from researchers at Penn State](https://sites.psu.edu/psucz/) (for those years plus 2010). More recently, Facebook/Meta [has developed](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/commuting-zones) its [own methodology](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/docs/methodology-commuting-zones) for estimating commuting zones, using location data collected from its users. The project’s [public dataset](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/commuting-zones) spans the world and specifies the zones not as sets of counties but as detailed, custom boundaries.


__Tech support scams.__ From 2018 to 2021, the now-shuttered [PopupDB Project](https://github.com/choozn/PopupDB-Data/) [collected](http://web.archive.org/web/20210307114123/https://popupdb.org/) information about [tech support scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-tech-support-scams) and their deceptive browser popups. Its maintainers have since released two final downloads: a “[light](https://github.com/choozn/PopupDB-Data/tree/main/databases)” dataset that lists the URLs and web hosts of 11,000+ such popups, and a “[full](https://popupdb.org/downloads)” database that includes screenshots and source code.

__Wordle words.__ [You](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html) [might](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wordle-has-turned-fans-of-word-games-into-argumentative-strategy-nerds-11641831311) [have](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle) [heard](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stefficao/how-wordle-went-viral-strategy) [of](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/01/13/wordle-perfect-pandemic-game-together/) [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). The game’s 2,315 possible answers and 12,972 permitted guesses are not an enormous secret, being embedded in its viewable source code. [The Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/)’s [Zach Wissner-Gross](https://twitter.com/xaqwg), for instance, has [extracted those word lists](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-the-riddler-met-wordle/) into [two](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-M0RIVVZqbeh0mZacdAsJyBrLuEmhKUhNaVAI-7pr2Y/edit#gid=0) [spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KR5lsyI60J1Ek6YgJRU2hKsk4iAOWvlPLUWjAZ6m8sg/edit#gid=0).
