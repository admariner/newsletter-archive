*Judicial financial disclosures, wildlife death and illness reports, a decade of news articles, more parliamentary speech, and Halloween candy.*


__Judicial financial disclosures.__ US federal judges must file annual reports disclosing their investments, external income, and other potential conflicts of interest. The filings are technically available to the public, [but onerous to access](https://free.law/2021/09/28/announcing-federal-financial-disclosures). So the [Free Law Project](https://free.law/) undertook an effort to obtain and [parse](https://github.com/freelawproject/disclosure-extractor) [as many of them as possible](https://www.courtlistener.com/coverage/financial-disclosures/), ultimately [creating a database](https://free.law/2021/10/15/financial-disclosures-now-available-to-all-on-courtlistener) of 250,000+ pages of disclosures, which you can [search online](https://www.courtlistener.com/financial-disclosures/) or [via an API](https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/#financialdisclosure-endpoint), including “complete coverage of every judge, justice, and magistrate between 2011 and 2018.” __Read more__: “[131 Federal Judges Broke the Law by Hearing Cases Where They Had a Financial Interest](https://www.wsj.com/articles/131-federal-judges-broke-the-law-by-hearing-cases-where-they-had-a-financial-interest-11632834421),” the first article in [an ongoing series by the WSJ](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Awsj.com+%22Hidden+Interests%22&t=h_&iar=news&ia=news), which had early access to the database.

__Wildlife death and illness reports.__ [WHISPers](https://whispers.usgs.gov/home), hosted by the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, is a “repository for sharing basic information about historic and ongoing wildlife mortality (death) and/or morbidity (illness) events,” with contributions from “hundreds of natural resource managers and stakeholders across the U.S. and beyond.” Wisconsin officials, for instance, [reported that a bald eagle died of lead poisoning in Adams County this April](https://whispers.usgs.gov/event/201296). You can search WHISPers by date range, county, species, diagnosis, and more — up to 500 events at a time, exportable as CSV files. [h/t [Terra R. Kelly et al.](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.0974)]


__A decade of news articles.__ For their [analysis of investigative publishing trends](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/what-analysis-6-million-articles-reveals-about-state-us-newspapers), [Eray Turkel et al.](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/30/e2105155118) gathered nearly 6 million articles published by 50 outlets (mostly local newspapers) in the 2010s, drawn from the pay-to-access [NewsBank](https://www.newsbank.com/about-newsbank) service. The study’s [public dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HSZ2QL) includes each article’s title, date, byline, and word and sentence count, plus various linguistic metrics calculated by the researchers. __Related__: To examine the online news economy, the Stanford-based team is [seeking volunteers to have certain web-browsing tracked](https://rally.mozilla.org/current-studies/beyond-the-paywall/index.html).

__More parliamentary speech.__ PhD candidate [Daniel Braby](https://twitter.com/dbrby)’s [parlCymru](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VILSR8) and [parlScot](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/EQ9WBE) provide the text of 5 and 20+ years of spoken contributions to the Welsh and Scottish parliaments, respectively, plus speaker and circumstance metadata. German publication [Dekoder](https://www.dekoder.org/)’s [Daniel Marcus](https://danilamorkovkin.blog/) has [gathered 385,000+ transcripts](https://www.discuss-data.net/dataset/fb52dac2-66e3-47a3-86c5-b2a3dadf41bf/) from 25+ years of speech in Russia’s [State Duma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Duma), powering a [interactive chart of word frequencies](https://duma.dekoder.org/de). __Previously__: [Spoken contributions to nine other parliaments](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/L4OAKN) ([DIP 2020.04.29](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-04-29-edition)).

__Halloween candy.__ For FiveThirtyEight’s “[Ultimate Halloween Candy Power Ranking](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/)” (2017), [Walt Hickey](https://walthickey.com/) [had readers vote](http://walthickey.com/2017/10/18/whats-the-best-halloween-candy/) on head-to-head matchups among 85 confections. The [project’s dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/candy-power-ranking) includes each candy’s winning percentage, various categorizations (e.g., Does it contain chocolate?), relative cost, and sugariness.
