*COVID-19 therapeutics, the 1950 Census, electric vehicle registrations, military alliances, and white sharks.*


__COVID-19 therapeutics.__ The US Department of Health & Human Services’ [COVID-19 Therapeutics Locator](https://covid-19-therapeutics-locator-dhhs.hub.arcgis.com/) tracks which pharmacies, hospitals, and other facilities have received government-procured COVID-19 drugs, and how much they have left. The therapeutics include one preventative antibody combination ([Evusheld](https://aspr.hhs.gov/COVID-19/Therapeutics/Products/Evusheld/Pages/default.aspx)) and several treatments ([bebtelovimab](https://aspr.hhs.gov/COVID-19/Therapeutics/Products/Bebtelovimab/Pages/default.aspx), [molnupiravir](https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/COVID19/investigation-MCM/molnupiravir/Pages/default.aspx), [Paxlovid](https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/COVID19/investigation-MCM/Paxlovid/Pages/default.aspx), and, until its distribution was recently paused, [sotrovimab](https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/COVID19/investigation-MCM/Sotrovimab/Pages/default.aspx)). The [underlying dataset](https://healthdata.gov/Health/COVID-19-Public-Therapeutic-Locator/rxn6-qnx8/) contains 39,000+ entries, one for each facility-therapeutic combination; they list the facility’s name and location, the drug, the number of courses available, and the time of the last update. __As seen in__: [Rob Relyea](https://github.com/rrelyea)’s [locators with current and historical data](https://rrelyea.github.io/).

__The 1950 Census.__ After 72 years of mandated confidentiality, the US government on Friday [released](https://1950census.archives.gov/) “over 165 terabytes” of microfilm digitized from the 1950 decennial Census. You can [search](https://1950census.archives.gov/search/) the scans, [which include](https://www.archives.gov/research/census/1950/faqs) millions of population schedules (the sheets that contain the details recorded about each household and resident), plus maps and descriptions of the survey’s [enumeration districts](https://1950census.archives.gov/howto/finding-aids.html). You can also [download the raw images and metadata files](https://www.archives.gov/developer/1950-census). [h/t [Eric Gardner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-gardner-0531aa9/) + [Michael E. Ruane](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/30/census-data-1950-secret-unveiled/)]


__Electric vehicle registrations.__ The US Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center [hosts dozens of vehicle-related datasets](https://afdc.energy.gov/data/categories/vehicles--2), including the [number of electric vehicle registrations in each state in 2020](https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10962), [hybrid sales by model from 1999 to 2019](https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10301), and a [database of manufacturers’ offerings](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/search/). __As seen in__: “[U.S. Has a Blueprint to Electrify Its Country Roads](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-22/u-s-has-a-blueprint-to-electrify-its-country-roads-for-evs)” (Bloomberg Opinion). __Previously__: [Alt-fuel stations](https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/) ([DIP 2021.09.08](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-09-08-edition/)).

__Military alliances.__ The [Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions](http://www.atopdata.org/) project, based at Rice University, examines “the content of military alliance agreements signed by all countries of the world between 1815 and 2018.” Its [dataset](http://www.atopdata.org/data.html) covers 760+ alliances, their various phases, and membership, with variables speaking to the formation, duration, obligations, and other aspects of the arrangements.

__White sharks.__ A collaboration led by the Monterey Bay Aquarium [has published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01235-3) a [dataset](https://portal.atn.ioos.us/#metadata/6e2ba85c-2f61-4bc5-8c2b-34d6734155ed/project) of location, pressure, light, and temperature measurements gathered from trackers attached to dozens of juvenile white sharks (*Carcharodon carcharias*) that researchers tagged off the coast of Southern California. The project ran from 2001 to 2020, when its “present and future status was adversely affected” by pandemic-related budget cuts. [h/t [Sharon Machlis](https://twitter.com/sharon000)]
