*State abortion laws, diaspora voting policies, automated driving crashes, Bay Area rents, and dendrochronology.*


__State abortion laws.__ The [Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/about), a “research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights,” maintains a [table summarizing each US state’s abortion laws](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/overview-abortion-laws). It examines key aspects of the legal landscape — such as gestational age limits, mandated counseling, and whether an abortion must be performed by a licensed physician — and links to topic-specific tables with [additional detail](https://www.guttmacher.org/united-states/abortion/state-policies-abortion). A [separate table](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe) categorizes, as of June 1, the policy implications in each state of overturning *Roe v. Wade*.  __Previously__: Guttmacher’s [state-level statistics on pregnancy, birth, and abortion](https://osf.io/kthnf/) ([DIP 2020.10.28](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-10-28-edition/)) and [Global Abortion Incidence Dataset](https://osf.io/5k7fp/) ([DIP 2021.04.14](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-04-14-edition/)), the World Health Organization’s [Global Abortion Policies Database](https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/) ([DIP 2021.10.13](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-10-13-edition/)), and Caitlin Knowles Myers’s [dataset of abortion facility distances](https://osf.io/8dg7r/) ([DIP 2022.02.02](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-02-02-edition/)).


__Diaspora voting policies.__ If you don’t live in your country of citizenship, can you still vote there? [Nathan Allen et al.](https://www.evrrdataset.com/team)’s [Extraterritorial Voting Rights and Restrictions Dataset](https://www.evrrdataset.com/) examines 20+ characteristics of 195 countries’ policies from 1950 to 2020. The [dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DIJQ3H)’s [variables](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=6337042) relate to dual citizenship, voter registration, mail-in ballots, and more. __Read more__: [An introductory Twitter thread from coauthor Elizabeth Iams Wellman](https://twitter.com/bethiamswellman/status/1539264747643756546).

__Automated driving crashes.__ Last June, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [issued a directive](https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting) requiring manufacturers and fleet operators to report certain crashes involving either [advanced driver assistance](https://www.nhtsa.gov/equipment/driver-assistance-technologies) or higher-level “automated driving systems.” Earlier this month, the agency [published its first release](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/initial-data-release-advanced-vehicle-technologies) of [crash report data](https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting), which it says “will be updated on a monthly basis.” The files describe each report and include information about the car, location, circumstances, and injury level.

__Bay Area rents.__ In 2018, economist [Kate Pennington](https://www.katepennington.org/) used the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to [collect data](https://www.katepennington.org/clmethod) on two decades of Craigslist posts advertising housing in the San Francisco Bay Area. The [results span 200,000+ listings between 2000 and 2018](https://www.katepennington.org/data), from which Pennington extracted each post’s date, price, bedroom count, location, and more. __Previously__: Twentieth-century San Francisco rents [from the city’s Housing Study DataBook](https://sfrb.org/san-francisco-housing-study-databook) and [transcribed from newspaper listings](https://experimental-geography.blogspot.com/2016/05/employment-construction-and-cost-of-san.html) ([DIP 2016.05.25](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-05-25-edition/)).

__Dendrochronology.__ The [Vernacular Architecture Group](https://www.vag.org.uk/)’s [Dendrochronology Database](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/vag_dendro/index.cfm) “provides the tree-ring dates for over 4500 buildings in the United Kingdom, ranging from cathedrals to cottages and barns.” Each [entry](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/vag_dendro/overview.cfm) lists a date range, dating method, location, building type, and descriptive notes.
