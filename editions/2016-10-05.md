Data Is Plural — 2016.10.05 edition
===================================

*Foreign aid, global schooling, student loans, R&D budgets, and six billion vehicles’ worth of traffic.*


__Global foreign aid.__ AidData, an organization [based at the College of William & Mary](http://aiddata.org/about-aiddatas-work), has compiled a [dataset of more than 1.5 million foreign aid projects](http://aiddata.org/country-level-research-datasets) between 1947 and 2013. Together, the dataset accounts for more than $7 trillion in commitments from 96 donors such as the U.S. government, UNICEF, the Nordic Development Fund, and the World Bank. AidData also publishes [geospatial datasets](http://aiddata.org/subnational-geospatial-research-datasets) and a [data user guide](http://aiddata.org/data-user-guide). __Previously:__ [ForeignAssistance.gov](http://beta.foreignassistance.gov/), [featured Jan. 13](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-01-13-edition).

__Educational attainment.__ Researchers at the Vienna-based [Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital](http://www.wittgensteincentre.org/en/index.htm) have developed a dataset of [historical and projected education levels for 171 countries](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-demographic-economics/article/a-harmonized-dataset-on-global-educational-attainment-between-1970-and-2060-an-analytical-window-into-recent-trends-and-future-prospects-in-human-capital-development/D5540E2C23E4CB89AF08ECD9379B38FD). For five-year age groups in each country, the project estimates the percentage of people in each of several categories of educational attainment — no education, primary education, secondary education, post-secondary education, and a few gradations in between. The dataset is available to browse and download via the [Wittgenstein Centre Data Explorer](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/fileadmin/subsites/Institute/VID/dataexplorer/index.html) – look for “Educational Attainment Distribution” in the “indicators” dropdown.


__Student loan default rates.__ The federal government publishes [default rates for federal student loans](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/student/default), aggregated by school, state, and school type. [Last week](http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/national-student-loan-cohort-default-rate-declines-steadily), it published data covering students whose loans were due for repayment beginning in FY2013.The national default rate for those students as of this August was 11.3%. At certain schools, however, more than a third of students defaulted. __More:__ [Some background on the 10 colleges with highest default rates](https://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/these-colleges-have-the-worst-student-loan-default-rates), by my colleague [Molly Hensley-Clancy](https://twitter.com/mollyhc).


__R&D spending.__ The UNESCO Institute for Statistics’ [data on national research and development budgets](http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SCN_DS&lang=en) contains estimates of personnel and total spending by field, funding source, and more. You can also [explore the data online through a series of interactive graphics](http://www.uis.unesco.org/_LAYOUTS/UNESCO/research-and-development-spending/).

__Highway traffic.__ FOIA enthusiast [Max Galka](https://twitter.com/galka_max) received [a month of highway traffic data](http://metrocosm.com/map-us-traffic/) from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The dataset “includes hourly traffic counts for each hour of each day of [November 2015] at approximately 4,000 continuous traffic counting locations nationwide.” In all, the dataset “amounts to a total of 14 million traffic count readings and a total of 6 billion vehicles counted.”
