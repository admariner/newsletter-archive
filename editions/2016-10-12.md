Data Is Plural — 2016.10.12 edition
===================================

*Presidential newspaper endorsements, forest cover, performances and exhibitions, computer memory prices, and the Kiwi fruits of statistical labor.*

&nbsp;

**Presidential newspaper endorsements.** [Noah Veltman](https://twitter.com/veltman) has collected all presidential endorsements (and non-endorsements) of 100+ major newspapers from 1980 (Reagan vs. Carter) to 2016. You can view the data [as a spreadsheet](https://github.com/veltman/endorsements/), or [as a formatted table](http://noahveltman.com/endorsements/).

**Forest cover.** The World Bank keeps [statistics on total forest coverage](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.FRST.K2) per country and worldwide. (Between 1990 and 2015, that worldwide total declined from 41.3 million to 40.0 million square kilometers.) More than 98% of all land area in Suriname was forest in 2015, [according to a related dataset](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.FRST.ZS?year_high_desc=true) — the highest proportion of any country.

&nbsp;

**Performances and exhibitions.** The New York Philharmonic’s [performance history dataset](https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory/) contains “all known concerts” — more than 20,000 of ‘em — played by the Philharmonic and the groups with which it has merged (e.g., the New York Symphony). Last month, the Museum of Modern Art published a dataset containing “[all of the known exhibitions held at the museum from 1929 through 1989](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/exhibitions)” — 1,788 in total. The first featured [Cézanne, Gauguin, Seurat, and van Gogh](http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1767).

&nbsp;

**Computer memory prices.** [John C. McCallum](http://www.jcmit.com/index.htm) has collected the [advertised prices of computer memory over time](http://www.jcmit.com/memoryprice.htm). In 1957, one byte of memory cost $392, or the equivalent of $411 million per megabyte; today, one metabyte costs about a third of a cent. [h/t [Jorge Luis](https://twitter.com/jorgeluis500)]

**“Murray, I think you dropped New Zealand's mineral exports for '08-'09.”** You don’t have to like [Flight of the Conchords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buoztHLk9JQ) to enjoy [New Zealand’s national statistics website](http://www.stats.govt.nz/), though it couldn’t hurt. The country publishes data on a broad range of topics, including [abortion](http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/health/abortion.aspx), [work stoppages](http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/income-and-work/Strikes.aspx), [the Māori census](http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/people_and_communities/maori.aspx), and, of course, [exports](http://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLECODE7311). In '08 and '09, the country exported NZD $3.5 billion and NZD $2.4 billion, respectively, of ”mineral fuels, mineral oils and products of their distillation; bituminous substances; mineral waxes.” [h/t [Drew Ivan](https://twitter.com/drewivan)]
