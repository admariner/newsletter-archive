Data Is Plural — 2018.04.04 edition
===================================

*Near-realtime satellite data, gender pay gaps in Great Britain, North Korea provocations, Russian presidential voting, and more dog (and cat) names.*


__The Western hemisphere.__ The [GOES-16 satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOES-16) was launched into orbit in November 2016, and it’s been collecting near-realtime images and data ever since. (GOES stands for “Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite.”) It [collects data on 16 different spectral bands](https://www.goes-r.gov/spacesegment/abi.html), and it can capture a full image of the Western Hemisphere every 15 minutes, plus “an image of the Continental U.S. every five minutes, and two smaller, more detailed images of areas where storm activity is present, every 60 seconds.” You can [browse the images and data online](https://www.goes-r.gov/multimedia/dataAndImageryImages.html), and also [download them as NetCDF files](http://edc.occ-data.org/goes16/). __Related:__ [Washington Post graphics reporter John Muyskens’ list of GOES-16 resources and usage examples](https://github.com/jmuyskens/nicar18-data-blitz-goes-16).

__Gender pay gaps in Great Britain.__ The UK government has begun requiring all companies with [at least 250 employees in Great Britain](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gender-pay-gap-reporting-overview) (i.e., England, Scotland, and Wales) to report the pay differences between their male and female workers. Today is the official deadline to submit the reports; as of last night, more than 8,800 employers had done so. The reports [include](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gender-pay-gap-reporting-overview#data-you-must-publish-and-report) the percentage gaps in hourly earnings, differences in bonus pay, and the proportions of male and female employees in each pay quartile. You can [search the data online](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/Viewing/search-results) and also [download it as a CSV](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/Viewing/download). __Related:__ [The Guardian’s series of reports on the data](https://www.theguardian.com/society/equal-pay).

__North Korea negotiations and provocations.__ The Center for Strategic and International Studies’ [Beyond Parallel project](https://beyondparallel.csis.org/about/) publishes [several databases](https://beyondparallel.csis.org/databases/) related to North Korean international relations — including 200+ negotiations between the U.S. and DPRK since 1990, and several hundred military provocations since 1958. __Related:__ [Los Angeles Times correspondent Matt Stiles’ visual explorations of the provocations data](http://thedailyviz.com/tag/provocations/). __Previously:__ [The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies’ North Korea Missile Test Database](http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/) ([DIP 2017.05.17](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-05-17-edition)).

__Russian presidential voting.__ Software engineer [Michael Penkov](http://michael.penkov.id.au/about/) has scraped the official, polling station–level results for Russia’s recent presidential election, and [made the data available](https://github.com/mpenkov/prezident2018) as a [single JSON file](https://github.com/mpenkov/prezident2018/blob/master/scrapyproject/results.json.gz). He’s also published an [introductory Python notebook](https://github.com/mpenkov/prezident2018/blob/master/Introduction.ipynb), which explains the data structure and provides English translations for the Russian field names.


__Even more dog (and cat) names.__ Last year, Data Is Plural pointed readers to [dog registration data for NYC, Tacoma, and Edmonton](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-05-31-edition). It turns out that government of Zurich also publishes [local dog registrations](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/data/en/dataset/https-data-stadt-zuerich-ch-dataset-pd_stapo_hundenamen), including each canine’s name, gender, and birth year. And the Sunshine Coast Council, in Australia, publishes a [spreadsheet of both dogs *and* cats](https://data.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Administration/Registered-Animals/7f87-i6kx/data), their primary breeds and colors, and whether they’ve been spayed/neutered.
