*Supreme gifts, internet politics, federal rural investments, fish-spawning areas, and Broadway attendance.*


__Supreme gifts.__ [Fix the Court](https://fixthecourt.com/about-us/) is a nonprofit that “advocates for non-ideological ‘fixes’ that would make the federal courts, and primarily the U.S. Supreme Court, more open and more accountable to the American people.” Earlier this month, they [published](https://fixthecourt.com/2024/06/a-staggering-tally-supreme-court-justices-accepted-hundreds-of-gifts-worth-millions-of-dollars/) a [series of spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14l25NLvBOd9sk4mArK4k7dtV0MUwxr5GBuLHL5Sp8lo/edit) tallying 500+ gifts accepted by the Supreme Court’s justices since 2000, with an estimated total value of $4.76 million. The findings “are largely based on last year’s groundbreaking work by ProPublica and includes data from stories in the New York Times, L.A. Times, the congressional record, annual disclosures,” and Fix the Court’s own work. The data indicate each gift’s year, recipient, description, giver, value, and the source of information. __Previously__: The [Free Law Project](https://free.law/)’s [database of federal judges’ financial disclosures](https://free.law/2021/10/15/financial-disclosures-now-available-to-all-on-courtlistener) ([DIP 2021.10.20](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-10-20-edition/)). __Related__: [ProPublica’s interactive database of the current justices’ disclosures](https://projects.propublica.org/supreme-connections/).


__Internet politics.__ The [Digital Society Project](https://digitalsocietyproject.org/), founded in 2018 as a collaboration with the [Varieties of Democracy initiative](https://www.v-dem.net/) ([DIP 2019.04.24](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-04-24-edition/)), “aims to answer some of the most important questions surrounding interactions between the internet and politics.” To do so, they conduct surveys of experts and ask them [questions such as](https://digitalsocietyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSP-Codebook-v6.pdf): “How often does the government shut down domestic access to the Internet?” and “How often do domestic elites use social media to organize offline political action of any kind?” The survey’s [downloadable datasets](https://digitalsocietyproject.org/data/) cover 170+ countries and provide aggregate metrics for each question.

__Federal rural investment.__ The Department of Agriculture’s [Rural Development](https://www.rd.usda.gov/) agency runs [dozens of financial assistance programs](https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services) to support housing, business, community facilities, telecommunications, and other developments in less populated areas of the United States. The agency’s [data gateway](https://www.rd.usda.gov/rural-data-gateway), [launched last year](https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/news-release/usda-launches-rural-data-gateway-strengthen-partnerships-and-expand-access-resources-people-rural-1), provides [dashboards](https://www.rd.usda.gov/rural-data-gateway/rural-investments) and [downloads](https://www.rd.usda.gov/rural-data-gateway/rural-investments/data) tracking these loans, loan guarantees, and grants going back to fiscal year 2012. At their most granular, the data [describe](https://www.rd.usda.gov/media/file/download/opendatadashboard-dictionarypdf) each investment’s type, amount, program, sector, ZIP code, city, state, and more.

__Fish-spawning areas.__ [Kimberly L. Oremus et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03348-3) have constructed a geospatial dataset that indicates the spawning locations and timing for 1,000+ saltwater fish in 2,900+ marine regions around the world. The authors primarily sourced — and then geocoded — the records from [FishBase](https://fishbase.mnhn.fr/home.php) (an initiative providing data on the habitats, body shapes, and other characteristics of 35,000+ fish species) and the [database](https://www.scrfa.org/database/) of [Science and Conservation of Fish Aggregations](https://www.scrfa.org/about/what-is-scfra/) (a nonprofit that focuses on massive reproductive gatherings of fish).


__Broadway attendance.__ The [Broadway League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Broadway_League)’s [Internet Broadway Database](https://www.ibdb.com/) lets you search the famed industry’s [theaters](https://www.ibdb.com/theatres/), [shows](https://www.ibdb.com/shows/), [casts and staff](https://www.ibdb.com/cast-staff/), [awards](https://www.ibdb.com/awards/), and more. It also publishes [charts and structured tables of weekly attendance and ticket revenue](https://www.ibdb.com/statistics/), additionally available for [individual shows](https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/stereophonic-538690#Statistics). The League itself also publishes [show-level statistics](https://www.broadwayleague.com/research/grosses-broadway-nyc/).
