Data Is Plural — 2017.03.29 edition
===================================

*Military spending, food surveillance, failed banks, (more) real-time air quality, and 100 million domain names.*


__Military spending.__ The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s [Military Expenditure Database](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex) is based on [official reports, International Monetary Fund yearbooks, newspaper articles, and other sources](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex/sources-and-methods). It covers most major countries since the 1950s and more than 100 countries since 1988. The dataset also quantifies military spending on a per-capita basis, as share of the country’s GDP, and as a proportion of total government spending. __Also__: The [Defense Manpower Data Center](https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/index.jsp) publishes spreadsheets detailing the number of active and reserve [U.S. personnel stationed in each state, territory, and foreign country](https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/dwp_reports.jsp). __Previously:__ [SIPRI’s database of international arms transfers](https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers) (Nov. 18, 2015).

__Food surveillance.__ Late last year, the FDA [began publishing](https://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2016/12/why-fda-is-making-data-extracted-from-reports-of-adverse-events-for-foods-and-cosmetics-available-to-the-public/) a dataset of [”adverse events” that have been reported to its Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition](https://www.fda.gov/Food/ComplianceEnforcement/ucm494015.htm). The database currently covers January 2004 through December 2016, and includes reports of (suspected) bad reactions to foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. For instance, the first row names a particular brand of chocolate chips as the potential culprit in the hospitalization of a two-year-old girl, whose symptoms included a rash, swelling face, cough, and difficulty breathing. __Previously:__ [FDA adverse event data for pharmaceutical drugs](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-05-18-edition) (May 18, 2016).

__Failed banks.__ The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation publishes a spreadsheet of [failed banks for which the agency has been appointed as a receiver](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html) — some 550 banks since October 2000. It also provides [short descriptions of each bank failure](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/bank/). The most recent: Proficio Bank of Cottonwood Heights, Utah, which closed on March 3. More on the FDIC’s receivership program [here](https://www.fdic.gov/about/strategic/strategic/receivership.html).


__Real-time air quality, part II.__ After [last week’s item](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-03-22-edition) on Berkeley Earth’s [real-time air quality data](http://berkeleyearth.org/air-quality-real-time-maps-data-download/), reader [Olaf Veerman](https://twitter.com/oBirdman) pointed me to [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org). The [open-source](https://github.com/openaq) project currently [gathers pollution data from nearly 5,500 locations in 47 countries](https://openaq.org/#/countries), aggregated “from real-time government and research grade sources.” You can download the data via [OpenAQ’s API](https://docs.openaq.org/).

__100 million domain names.__ The anonymously-published [DNS Census 2013](https://dnscensus2013.neocities.org/) “is an attempt to provide a public dataset of registered domains and DNS records” — essentially the Internet’s phone book. The dataset, which [has also been uploaded to the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/DNSCensus2013), includes 2.7 billion Domain Name System records and 106,928,034 distinct domains, [organized by extension](https://archive.org/download/DNSCensus2013/2nd-level-domains/) (e.g., .com, .info, .edu).
