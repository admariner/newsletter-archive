*K-12 learning arrangements, rushing waters, voluntary union recognition, four decades of Spanish elections, and cryptic crossword clues.*


__K-12 learning arrangements.__ The [COVID-19 School Data Hub](https://www.covidschooldatahub.com), which [launched last week](https://emilyoster.substack.com/p/special-edition-today-covid-19-school), is “a central database for educators, researchers, and policymakers to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic shaped students’ modes of learning in 2020-21.” The project’s team, led by economist [Emily Oster](https://emilyoster.net/), has gathered data on learning models (in-person, virtual, or hybrid) used by public schools and districts at various points in time, their masking policies, and reported COVID-19 cases. The datasets can be [downloaded in bulk](https://www.covidschooldatahub.com/for_researchers) or [by state](https://www.covidschooldatahub.com/explore_by_state). The coverage and granularity vary by topic and state; the project’s [documentation](https://www.covidschooldatahub.com/methods) describes the collection methods and availability. 


__Rushing waters.__ The US Geological Survey’s [National Water Information System](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) provides data on the “occurrence, quantity, quality, distribution, and movement of surface and underground waters” around the country. The [surface water measurements](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/sw) — mainly [streamflow and gage height](https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/tutorials/surface-water-data/how-do-i-interpret-gage-height-and-streamflow-values) — come from tens of thousands of monitoring sites. ([Here’s a site near Baton Rouge](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/07378000/#parameterCode=00065&startDT=2021-08-26&endDT=2021-09-21) before and after [hurricanes Ida and Nicholas](https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_c06a0dba-159b-11ec-9f44-7769e5bab072.html).) There’s an [API for accessing the records](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/), including [daily summaries](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/DV-Service.html) and [real-time measurements](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Service.html). __Previously__: [NOAA’s water-level data](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/nwlon.html) ([DIP 2016.03.23](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-03-23-edition/)).

__Voluntary union recognition.__ Civic technologist [Forest Gregg](https://twitter.com/forestgregg) has begun [filing FOIA requests](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/voluntary-recognitions-january-1-june-30-2021-116304/) to the National Labor Relations Board [to collect newly-available data](https://github.com/labordata/nlrb-voluntary-recognitions) on employers’ voluntary recognition of employee unions, drawn from agency’s [relevant notification form](https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-195/5581_7-20.pdf). The [records so far](https://flatgithub.com/labordata/nlrb-voluntary-recognitions/blob/main/voluntary_recognitions.csv?sort=Date%20VR%20Request%20Received%2Cdesc) include 70+ recognitions in late 2020 and early 2021, plus nearly 1,000 from a prior reporting program between 2007 and 2009; they list the employer, union, case number, relevant dates, and more. __Previously__: [Union election results](https://www.nlrb.gov/reports/graphs-data/recent-election-results) ([DIP 2021.05.05](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-05-05-edition/)).


__Four decades of Spanish elections.__ The [Spanish Electoral Archive](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00975-y), published this summer, provides detailed results of all municipal, regional, general, and European Parliament elections in Spain since the country’s [transition to democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_transition_to_democracy) in the late 1970s. The [project](http://sea.uv.es/gipeyop/sea.html)’s [datasets](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/SEA) standardize records from various official sources that, in many cases, drill down to the level of individual ballot boxes.


__Hidden clue here will be!__ Data scientist [George Ho](https://www.eigenfoo.xyz/) has compiled a [dataset of 589,000+ clues](https://cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz/) to [cryptic crosswords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword), “collected from various blogs and publicly available digital archives.” The collection, [released](https://github.com/eigenfoo/cryptics/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) earlier this month, is available to download and also [explore online](https://cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz/clues/clues). ([For example](https://cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz/clues/clues?_sort=rowid&clue__contains=%21&answer__exact=CRYPTIC).) Its “[datasheet](https://cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz/datasheet)” describes the motivation, collection process, composition, and more.
