__NYC shelter counts.__ Every night, tens of thousands of people stay in New York City homeless shelters, which are managed by a half-dozen city agencies. Earlier this year, [thanks to a 2022 law](https://citylimits.org/2023/07/24/as-homeless-population-booms-nyc-steps-closer-to-an-accurate-shelter-census/), the city began publishing [monthly statistics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Local-Law-79-2022-Temporary-Housing-Assistance-Usa/jiwc-ncpi) on shelter population counts and average lengths of stay, broken down by agency, program, and family composition. One agency, the Department of Homeless Services, [publishes some structured daily data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/DHS-Daily-Report/k46n-sa2m), but shares its most comprehensive daily counts as [a nightly-overwritten PDF](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dhs/downloads/pdf/dailyreport.pdf). So [Patrick Spauster](https://patrickspauster.com/) and [Adrian Nesta](https://justanesta.com/) have built a [data pipeline](https://github.com/anesta95/nyc_shelter_count) to scrape, archive, and standardize these datasets, and have [partnered with City Limits](https://citylimits.org/2023/12/07/tracking-nycs-record-high-homeless-shelter-population/) to revamp [the publication‚Äôs shelter population tracker](https://citylimits.org/nyc-shelter-count/). In October, more than 143,000 people slept in the city‚Äôs shelters, the highest monthly count on record.


__US solar facilities.__ The [United States Large-Scale Solar Photovoltaic Database](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uspvdb/), released last month, maps and describes 3,600+ solar power facilities with capacities of at least 1 megawatt. The project, a collaboration between the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and US Geological Survey, includes an [online viewer](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uspvdb/viewer/), [downloadable database](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uspvdb/data/), and [API](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uspvdb/api-doc/) (with [example usage](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uspvdb/assets/data/uspvdbApiNotebook.html)). The data indicate each facility‚Äôs boundary and centroid coordinates, state, county, and site type, plus data extracted from [EIA Form 860](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/), such as capacity, axis type, tilt angle, and more. __Related__: A [map](https://ilsolarmap.com/) and [dataset](https://github.com/chihacknight/il-solar-map/tree/main/data/v2/final) of [Illinois solar installations](https://ilsolarmap.com/about.html), large and small, compiled by volunteers at [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/about). __Previously__: The [Global Energy Monitor](https://globalenergymonitor.org/about/our-story/)‚Äôs [Global Solar Power Tracker](https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-solar-power-tracker/) ([DIP 2022.06.01](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-06-01-edition/)).

__State supreme court justices.__ [David A. Hughes et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly/article/abs/updating-pajid-scores-for-state-supreme-court-justices-19702019/7EEE00DC60CB4D0F883B7E5BECDE116F), building on [prior work](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1111/0022-3816.00018), have calculated ideology scores (on a conservative-liberal continuum) for 1,600+ state supreme court justices from 1970 to 2019. For each justice and year, the [dataset](https://dataverse.unc.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.15139/S3/M6U77I) provides the justice‚Äôs state, last name, political affiliation, the authors‚Äô ideology score estimates, and ideology scores produced by two other research teams. __Previously__: Ideology estimates for [state legislators](https://americanlegislatures.wordpress.com/) ([DIP 2020.01.01](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-01-01-edition/)), [members of Congress](https://voteview.com/) ([DIP 2023.03.01](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-03-01-edition/)), and [local populations](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/americanideologyproject) ([DIP 2023.08.02](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-08-02-edition/)).


__Antimicrobial peptides.__ In a [recent journal article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pro.4778), the University of Nebraska Medical Center‚Äôs [Guangshun Wang](https://www.unmc.edu/pathology/faculty/bios/wang.html) discusses the history and future of the [Antimicrobial Peptide Database](https://aps.unmc.edu/), which his lab launched more than 20 years ago. The database now catalogs 3,500+ such molecules, which [play an important role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_peptides) in the [innate immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system). You can [search the peptides](https://aps.unmc.edu/database) by name, [structural and functional properties](https://aps.unmc.edu/about), source organism, and other criteria, and can [download their amino acid sequences](https://aps.unmc.edu/downloads).


__Finland transport.__ The [Finnish Transport and Communications Agency](https://tieto.traficom.fi/en/)‚Äôs [public datasets](https://tieto.traficom.fi/en/datatraficom/open-data) span a range of topics, including the radio spectrum, mobile networks, cybersecurity, registered vehicles, ships, aircraft, and more. It also publishes [downloadable statistics](https://trafi2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/TraFi/) unavailable from many other countries, such as [passenger cars‚Äô inspection failure rates by make, model, and year](https://tieto.traficom.fi/en/statistics/statistics-inspections) and [driving exam results](https://tieto.traficom.fi/en/statistics/statistics-driving-and-theory-tests).
