Data Is Plural — 2018.01.24 edition
===================================

*Global trade dynamics, financial well-being, remoteness, Greek life at Duke, and instant ramen ratings.*

&nbsp;

**Global trade dynamics.** [The Atlas of Economic Complexity](http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/) has collected decades of import/export data from [the United Nations Comtrade database](https://comtrade.un.org/), and then applied “a unique method to clean the data to account for inconsistent reporting practices.” You can [download the raw data](https://intl-atlas-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), learn more about the cleaning process in [the FAQ](http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/learn/faq), [explore current and historical trade flows](http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/), and browse the Atlas’s rankings of countries by “[economic complexity](http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/rankings/).” **Related:** The researchers have also created regionally-detailed economic atlases of [Mexico](http://complejidad.datos.gob.mx/) and [Columbia](http://datlascolombia.com/).

**Financial well-being.** The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s [National Financial Well-Being Survey](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/financial-well-being-survey-data/) collected more than 6,000 responses to the agency’s 10-question [Financial Well-Being Scale](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/financial-well-being/), plus additional demographic and financial information. The survey results, which were collected in late 2016, come with a [detailed methodology and data dictionary](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_nfwbs-puf-user-guide.pdf). **Plus:** You can [take the questionnaire yourself](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/financial-well-being/), anonymously.

**How long does it take to get to the nearest city?** A team led by researchers at the University of Oxford’s Malaria Atlas Project have [estimated the time it would take](https://map.ox.ac.uk/research-project/accessibility_to_cities/) (as of 2015) to get from any square kilometer in the world to the nearest city of 50,000+ people. The analysis, which improves upon [a similar effort from 15 years earlier](http://forobs.jrc.ec.europa.eu/products/gam/index.php), benefits from “the first-ever, global-scale synthesis of two leading roads datasets – Open Street Map (OSM) data and distance-to-roads data derived from the Google roads database.” You can download the data as a GeoTIFF, or [explore the map online](https://roadlessforest.eu/map.html).

&nbsp;

**Duke’s Greeks.** [Using a range of public sources](http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2018/01/editors-note-regarding-recent-article-on-greek-life), the The Duke Chronicle [collected data on all 1,739 students listed](https://github.com/Chrissymbeck/Greek-Life-Demographics) in the Class of 2018’s “Freshman Picture Book” — including their hometowns, details about their high schools, whether they won a merit scholarship, and whether they play on a sports team — in order to analyze “trends between those who do and don't join Greek life at Duke.” **Related:** “[Is Greek life at Duke as homogenous as you think?](http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2018/01/is-greek-life-at-duke-as-homogenous-as-you-think),” the first story in the Chronicle’s multipart series based on the data.

**Ramen ratings.** Hans Lienesch calls himself [The Ramen Rater](https://www.theramenrater.com/about-2-2/about-2/), and (as his website’s banner declares) he’s been “Celebrating the Instant Noodle for 15 Years.” Over that time, he’s amassed [a spreadsheet of more than 2,600 ratings](https://www.theramenrater.com/resources-2/the-list/).
