Data Is Plural — 2016.05.11 edition
===================================

*Panama Papers, Kepler planets, “marihuana” handlers, obesity, and upward mobility.*


__Secret offshore companies.__ On Monday, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists [released data](https://panamapapers.icij.org/blog/20160509-offshore-database-release.html) on 210,000 companies, trusts, and funds named in the massive Panama Papers leak. The database is [searchable online](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/) and [downloadable as several CSV files](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database). The dataset includes companies’ officers, registered addresses, and middlemen. It supplements a pre-existing cache of of 105,000 companies named in [ICIJ’s 2013 "Offshore Leaks" investigation](https://www.icij.org/offshore).


__Potentially habitable planets.__ Since 2009, [NASA’s *Kepler* spacecraft](http://kepler.nasa.gov/) has been looking for Earth-like exoplanets — i.e., planets outside our solar system. Through the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/intro.html), you can explore, filter, and download databases of “candidate” and “confirmed” exoplanets, including [*Kepler*’s discoveries](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=cumulative).

__“Marihuana.”__ [The Institute for Cannabis](http://birrenbach.com/INSTITUTE/) (established in 1985 as The Institute for Hemp) has obtained, via FOIA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s list of [organizations licensed to handle marijuana](http://birrenbach.com/INSTITUTE/foia/dea/) — or, as [the license application form](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugreg/reg_apps/225/225_form.pdf) calls it, “marihuana.” Many of the nearly 3,000 licensees are law enforcement organizations, but universities, pharmacies, and hospitals also pepper the list.

__Obesity over time.__ An [international network of researchers](http://www.ncdrisc.org/) who study noncommunicable diseases estimates the [annual prevalence of obesity](http://www.ncdrisc.org/d-adiposity.html) and [diabetes](http://www.ncdrisc.org/d-diabetes.html) for approximately 200 countries and territories around the world. The data currently covers 1975–2014 and is based, on 2,000+ surveys, [according to the group](http://www.ncdrisc.org/about-us.html). __Related:__ [Bloomberg’s chart and maps of the data](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-global-obesity/).


__Upward mobility.__ In response to a freedom-of-information request, the NYC Department of Buildings provided WNYC with a [spreadsheet of 76,088 “registered elevator devices” in the city](https://github.com/datanews/elevators). Elevators and escalators dominate the list, but you’ll also find dumbwaiters, handicap lifts, and a few other vertical transporters. The spreadsheet includes data on location, speed, maximum capacity, floors served, and more. __Related:__ [FiveThirtyEight analyzed the data last week](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorks-elevators-define-the-city/).
