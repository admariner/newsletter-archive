Data Is Plural — 2017.09.13 edition
===================================

*Global flooding, more house price indices, political facetime, SEC server logs, and wood densities.*


__Global flooding.__ The [Dartmouth Flood Observatory](http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/index.html)’s [Global Archive of Large Flood Events](http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Archives/index.html) contains data about 4,500+ floods, dating back to 1985. It’s updated often, and is available in Excel, XML, HTML, and geospatial formats. The [variables include](http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Archives/ArchiveNotes.html) each flood’s location, timespan, severity, main cause, and estimated impact. The organization also publishes detailed maps of the “maximum observed flooding” for specific disasters, such as [for Hurricane Harvey](http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Events/2017USA4510/2017USA4510.html) and [for Hurricane Irma](http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Events/2017USA4516/2017USA4516.html). __Related:__ [A Science Magazine mini-profile of the DFO and its founder](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/colorado-global-flood-observatory-keeps-close-watch-harvey-s-torrents). __Previously:__ [U.S. tide gauges and flood observations](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-03-23-edition) (DIP 2016.03.23), [UK coastal flooding](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-08-09-edition) (DIP 2017.08.09), and [FEMA flood risk maps](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-08-30-edition) (DIP 2017.08.30).


__House price indices, part two.__ Two weeks ago, [DIP featured](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-08-30-edition) Case-Shiller’s home price index data. There are, in fact, several other prominent (and downloadable) house price indices, including the [Federal Housing Finance Agency’s House Price Index](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index.aspx), the [National Association of Realtors’ indices](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics), and [Zillow’s Home Value Index](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). __Helpful:__ [This guide to various home price indices and how they’re constructed](http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2012/05/kolko-dissecting-house-price-indices.html), by [Jed Kolko](http://jedkolko.com/), formerly Trulia’s chief economist. __Related:__ [This critique of Case-Shiller’s approach](http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2014/08/kolko-lets-improve-not-ignore-seasonal.html), also by Kolko.


__Trump, McConnell, Schumer, Ryan, and Pelosi on TV.__ The Internet Archive has pumped footage from CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, and the BBC through software trained to recognize the faces of Donald Trump and majority/minority leaders of the U.S. House and Senate. The result: [Face-O-Matic](https://archive.org/details/faceomatic), a dataset [released to the public last week](http://blog.archive.org/2017/09/06/face-o-matic-data-show-trump-dominates/). For each face the software found, the dataset includes the network, program, date, time, duration, and a link to the footage on the [TV News Archive](https://archive.org/details/tv). Since mid-July, Face-O-Matic has logged more than 50,000 sightings. [h/t [Nancy Watzman](https://twitter.com/nwatzman)]


__SEC server logs.__ When companies file reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, they do so through the SEC’s [EDGAR system](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). The SEC makes those filings available online, and it uses EDGAR’s server logs to analyze web traffic to the site. The SEC’s [EDGAR Log File Data Set](https://www.sec.gov/data/edgar-log-file-data-set.html) contains a set CSVs — one for each day between February 14, 2003 and December 31, 2016 — extracted from those server logs. For each document visited, the data includes the visitor’s unique-but-obfuscated IP address, the date and time of the visit, the IDs of the document and associated company, and some information about the visitor’s browser.

__It wood be hard to ignore this dataset.__ The “robust and curated” [Global Wood Density Database](http://wooddensity.univ-tlse3.fr/) contains [more than 16,000 entries](http://datadryad.org/handle/10255/dryad.235), culled from scientific literature, websites, and unpublished scholarship. The densest so far is a *[Caesalpinia sclerocarpa](https://www.desertmuseum.org/programs/alamos_trees_caescl.php)* from Mexico, weighing in at 1.39 grams per cubic centimeter. __Related:__ [The TRY database of “curated plant traits”](https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Database.php) (free registration required).
