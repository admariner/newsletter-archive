*üëã Job alert: [I‚Äôm hiring three data reporters at The New York Times to collaborate across the newsroom](https://nytimes.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/NYT/job/New-York-NY/Reporter--Data--Data-Journalism-Team_REQ-017278-1). Follow that link for details and feel free to email me with any questions.*


__Disability claims processing.__ The Social Security Administration publishes [monthly](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/data/ssa-sa-mowl.htm) and [annual](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/data/ssa-sa-fywl.htm) datasets tracking each state agency‚Äôs progress [processing](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm) disability claims. The datasets, which go back to October 2000, count the number of initial claims received, pending, determined, and approved by each agency during each period, as well as similar breakdowns for denial reconsiderations and [continuing disability reviews](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-cdrs-ussi.htm). The administration‚Äôs [extensive catalog of public datasets](https://www.ssa.gov/open/data/) also includes several that measure the waiting involved, such as [monthly average initial claim processing times](https://www.ssa.gov/open/data/Combined-Disability-Processing-Time.html), [average wait times for reconsiderations](https://www.ssa.gov/open/data/disability_reconsideration_average_processing_time.html), and [wait times for administrative hearings](https://www.ssa.gov/appeals/DataSets/01_NetStat_Report.html). __As seen in__: ‚Äú[Wait times for Social Security disability benefit decisions reach new high](https://usafacts.org/data-projects/disability-benefit-wait-time)‚Äù (USAFacts).


__Evapotranspiration.__ With the goal of ‚Äúfilling the biggest data gap in water management,‚Äù the [OpenET](https://etdata.org/) project [uses satellite imagery](https://etdata.org/methodologies/), weather data, and other sources to estimate the volume of [evapotranspiration](https://etdata.org/faq/) ‚Äî ‚Äúthe process by which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere‚Äù ‚Äî at a 30-meter resolution across 17 states in the western US. The results are available to [explore via an online map](https://explore.etdata.org/) of annual cumulative evapotranspiration (2019‚Äì2024), as [monthly datasets via Earth Engine](https://openet.gitbook.io/docs/additional-resources/data-archives), and [through an API](https://openet.gitbook.io/docs).

__Fuel forecasts.__ The US Energy Information Administration‚Äôs monthly [Short-Term Energy Outlook](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/) provides forecasts and recent trends of energy supply, consumption, prices, and inventory. It covers a range of commodities and electricity sources, such as crude oil, coal, natural gas, gasoline, renewables, and nuclear. Starting with its September 2024 report, the outlooks have also [begun to include more detailed data on biofuels](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63384), available in [Table 4d](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/data/browser/#/?v=11) of its [structured datasets](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/data.php). 


__Trash balloons.__ Since May of this year, North Korea has floated thousands of trash-carrying balloons into South Korea. A team from the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/)‚Äô [Beyond Parallel](https://beyondparallel.csis.org/about/) project has [mapped 160+ known balloon landing locations](https://beyondparallel.csis.org/map-of-north-koreas-garbage-filled-balloons/), based on public sources. The map‚Äôs downloadable data indicates the each landing‚Äôs date, associated ‚Äúwave,‚Äù coordinates, location name, and province. __As seen in__: [Reuters‚Äô visually immersive article on the topic](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/NORTHKOREA-SOUTHKOREA/TRASH/klvynygmjpg/).

__Anglo-Saxons on record.__ The [Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England](https://pase.ac.uk/) project ‚Äúaims to provide structured information relating to all the recorded inhabitants of England from the late sixth to the late eleventh century.‚Äù Built over (relatively less) time by [several teams](https://pase.ac.uk/about/introduction/) at UK universities, PASE is ‚Äúbased on a systematic examination of the available written sources for the period, including chronicles, saints‚Äô *Lives*, charters, *libri vitae*, inscriptions, Domesday Book and coins.‚Äù The [Domesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book)-focused [portion of the project](https://pase.ac.uk/domesday/) features a downloadable table of 17,000+ landholders from that manuscript, listing their name (where known), gender, description, value of holdings, and linking to details about those holdings.
