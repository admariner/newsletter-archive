Data Is Plural — 2016.05.18 edition
===================================

*Drug safety, fossils, immigrants, parking tickets, and one million musical artists.*

&nbsp;

**Drug safety.** To help monitor drug safety, the FDA collects “[adverse event](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/default.htm)” reports submitted by patients, doctors, and manufacturers. You can [download the (anonymized) reports from the FDA directly](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm082193.htm), but that dataset includes duplicate cases, and sometimes calls the same drug by different names. A group of researchers [recently announced](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201626) that they’ve cleaned up the data — removing duplicates and standardizing nomenclature — so that you don’t have to. The [resulting dataset](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.8q0s4) covers 4,245 drugs, more than 17,000 types of reactions, and nearly 5 million case reports. **Previously:** [The SIDER database of pharmaceutical side effects](http://sideeffects.embl.de/), [featured Nov. 11, 2015](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2015-11-11-edition).

&nbsp;

**Fossils.** The [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org), run by a non-profit group of researchers, has aggregated data on more than a million fossils from all around the world. You can access the dataset — organized by species, era, and location — via [an interactive map](https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/), [download form](https://paleobiodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?a=displayDownloadGenerator), or [API](https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/occs/list_doc.html).

&nbsp;

**Immigrants, internationally.** The United Nations publishes [estimates of the number of foreign-born residents](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates15.shtml) living in every country. The figures cover 1990 to 2015, at five-year intervals. The Vatican (100% foreign-born) and the United Arab Emirates (88%) had the highest proportion of immigrant residents in 2015; the U.S. (46.6 million) boasted the largest total immigrant population. The dataset also includes estimates by age, sex, and country of origin. **Previously:** [Refugees in America](http://www.wrapsnet.org/Reports/InteractiveReporting/tabid/393/Default.aspx), [featured Nov. 25, 2015](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2015-11-25-edition).

**Tens of millions of parking tickets.** *[I Quant NY](http://iquantny.tumblr.com/)* author Ben Wellington recently discovered that New York City had been “[ticketing legally parked cars for millions of dollars a year](http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/144197004989/the-nypd-was-systematically-ticketing-legally).” To reach that finding, Wellington analyzed [three](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2014-August-/jt7v-77mi) [years](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2015/c284-tqph) of [parking tickets](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2016/kiv2-tbus), amounting to more than 30 million summonses. NYC isn’t alone in providing parking ticket data; [Philadelphia](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/parking-violations), [Toronto](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=ca20256c54ea4310VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD), [Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Transportation/Parking-Citations/n4ma-fj3m), [Seattle](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Parking-Violations-All/q2m9-8vqf), and others publish similar datasets.

&nbsp;

**Musical metadata.** The [MusicBrainz database](https://musicbrainz.org/) contains metadata on [more than one million artists](https://musicbrainz.org/statistics), 16 million recordings, 900,000 pieces of cover art. You can [download the data in bulk](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Download) or [query it via an API](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2). **Previously:** The smaller-but-more-detailed [Million Song Dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/), [featured Feb. 10](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-02-10-edition).
