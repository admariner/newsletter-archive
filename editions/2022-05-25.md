===================================

*Supercomputers, infrastructure permitting, European election results, Moreno and Jennings’ sociograms, and Art Garfunkel’s library.*


__Supercomputers.__ Since 1993, a [team of researchers](https://www.top500.org/project/authors/) has regularly assessed the most powerful computers in the world. The resulting [TOP500 lists](https://www.top500.org/) are published twice a year, in June and November, using a [performance benchmark developed by team member Jack Dongarra](https://www.top500.org/project/linpack/), who [became a Turing Award laureate this year](https://www.acm.org/media-center/2022/march/turing-award-2021). Downloadable versions indicate each supercomputer’s name, rank, location, manufacturer, year built, power consumption, technical specifications, and more. __As seen in__: “[The race to build the fastest supercomputer](https://blog.datawrapper.de/the-race-to-build-the-fastest-supercomputer/),” by Datawrapper’s [Edurne Morillo](https://twitter.com/EdurneMG), who recommends visiting Barcelona’s [MareNostrum](https://www.bsc.es/marenostrum/marenostrum), which ranked 74th on the [latest list](https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/list/2021/11/) and is housed in a former chapel.


__Infrastructure permitting.__ The US government’s [Federal Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard](https://www.permits.performance.gov/) tracks the “environmental review and authorization processes for large or complex infrastructure projects,” [particularly](https://www.permits.performance.gov/about) those funded by the Department of Transportation and those participating in a [voluntary review-coordination effort known as FAST-41](https://www.epa.gov/sustainability/fast-41-coordination). The dashboard’s [full dataset](https://data.permits.performance.gov/Permitting-Project/Permitting-Dashboard-Full-Dataset/mcm3-xbid) describes 12,000+ milestones relating to nearly 1,000 projects, roughly half of which have been completed. Online, you can [search across projects](https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects) and browse their characteristics and timetables.


__European election results.__ [Dominik Schraff et al.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13540688221083553) have built [EU-NED](https://eu-ned.com/), a dataset that harmonizes European election results at a subnational level, providing party vote totals for 31 countries’ [NUTS 2 and NUTS 3 geographic units](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/background). The [dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IQRYP5) covers 1990 to 2020 and uses party identifiers from [PartyFacts](https://partyfacts.herokuapp.com/) ([DIP 2019.01.16](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-01-16-edition/)), making it easier to link the records to other projects.

__Moreno and Jennings’ sociograms.__ In the 1930s, [Jacob Moreno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_L._Moreno) and [Helen Hall Jennings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Hall_Jennings) created a series of “[sociograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociogram)” representing the seating preferences of grade-school classmates.  These graphics “are frequently considered as the first examples of social network analysis and visualization,” [according to](http://www.martingrandjean.ch/social-network-analysis-visualization-morenos-sociograms-revisited/) historian and network analysis practitioner [Martin Grandjean](http://www.martingrandjean.ch/), who has [translated them into simple data files](https://github.com/grandjeanmartin/sociograms). [h/t [Christian Miles](https://sourcetarget.email/editions/41/) + [Jer Thorp](https://www.mcdbooks.com/books/living-in-data)]


__Art Garfunkel’s library.__ The [legendary folk singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Garfunkel)’s [official website](https://www.artgarfunkel.com/) includes [a catalog](https://www.artgarfunkel.com/library.html) of “every book Art has read since 1968.” It lists each book’s title, author, year published, month/year read, page count, and whether it was [one of the musician’s favorites](https://www.artgarfunkel.com/books.html). Recently, AI engineer [Corey Christensen](https://www.kaggle.com/chrico03) converted the HTML pages into a [downloadable dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chrico03/art-garfunkels-library).
