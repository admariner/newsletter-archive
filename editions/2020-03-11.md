Data Is Plural — 2020.03.11 edition
===================================

*More coronavirus data, plus political parties, SFO flights, Tour de France cyclists, and penguins.*

&nbsp;

*But first ... at BuzzFeed News, we’re [hiring a **paid** summer intern](https://boards.greenhouse.io/buzzfeed/jobs/2117225?gh_jid=2117225) to help us use data to cover the US presidential election (and possibly other things). If you apply, let me know at jeremy.singer-vine@buzzfeed.com; I’ll make sure to personally review all applications from DIP readers. Also feel free to send me any questions beforehand.*

**More coronavirus data.** Last month, [DIP featured](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-02-05-edition) coronavirus case counts [mapped by researchers at Johns Hopkins](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). Since then, efforts to collect and publish COVID-19 data have grown, including: the Johns Hopkins team has [moved its data repository to GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) ... the [Open COVID-19 Data Curation Group](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30119-5/fulltext) has [expanded its data on individual cases](https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019) ... the Italian government is publishing [local case and test counts on GitHub](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19) ... Princeton PhD student [Sang Woo Park](https://twitter.com/sang_woo_park) is building a [detailed dataset of cases in South Korea](https://github.com/parksw3/COVID19-Korea) ... the decade-old [Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data](https://www.gisaid.org/) is sharing [COVID-19 genome samples and mutations](https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/next-hcov-19-app/) ... while the collaboratively-edited [CoronavirusTechHandbook.com](https://coronavirustechhandbook.com/) is pointing to additional datasets and data-trackers. **Related**: My colleague [Peter Aldhous](https://www.peteraldhous.com/) is using the Johns Hopkins data to publish clear, concise graphics tracking known case counts [globally](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/coronavirus-updating-charts-maps-us-states) and [in the United States](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/coronavirus-updating-charts-maps-us-states).

**Political parties around the world.** The [Global Party Survey](https://www.globalpartysurvey.org/methods) is “an international scientific study, directed by Pippa Norris, designed to compare political parties around the world. Drawing on survey data gathered from 1,861 party and election experts, the study uses 21 core items to estimate key ideological values, issue positions, and populist rhetoric for 1,127 parties in 170 countries.” Last month, [Norris](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/pippa-norris) released [the dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/GlobalPartySurvey) and a [paper that uses it to measure](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/measuring-populism-worldwide) “populism as a global phenomenon.” **Previously**: [The Manifesto Project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/) ([DIP 2017.06.21](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-06-21-edition)) and [Party Facts](https://partyfacts.herokuapp.com/) ([DIP 2019.01.16](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-01-16-edition)).

&nbsp;

**Flights in and out of SFO.** San Francisco International Airport’s [museum team](https://millsfield.sfomuseum.org/about/) has been [collecting information](https://millsfield.sfomuseum.org/blog/2019/05/17/flights/) on all flights in and out of SFO’s terminals. Online, you can [browse and search the data](https://millsfield.sfomuseum.org/flights/), which includes details about the airlines, flight numbers, gates of arrival and departure, and more. Earlier this year, the team [published a downloadable database](https://millsfield.sfomuseum.org/blog/2020/01/24/flightdata/) of 769,250 flights from 2019. (Or 1.2 million flights, if you count [codeshares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeshare_agreement).) [h/t [Simon Batistoni](https://buttondown.email/vaguemtn)]

&nbsp;

**Bicycle racers.** Applied mathematics PhD student [Thomas Camminady](https://camminady.org/) has built a [spreadsheet of all Tour de France riders since 1903](https://github.com/camminady/LeTourDataSet/) (including name, team, time taken, and final ranking), based on [the competition’s official results page](https://www.letour.fr/en/history).

&nbsp;

**Penguins.** The [MAPPPD project](http://www.penguinmap.com/) — Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics — “aims to deliver open access penguin population data for the Antarctic continent, and occupancy probabilities for flying birds around the Antarctic Peninsula.” The data, last updated about a year ago, can be both [browsed online and downloaded](http://www.penguinmap.com/mapppd).
