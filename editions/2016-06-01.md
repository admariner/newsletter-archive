Data Is Plural — 2016.06.01 edition
===================================

*American veterans, African farmers, global inequality, spelling bees, and the LEGO-verse.*


__Veterans in America.__ In 2014, approximately 22 million U.S. military veterans were still alive, including 1 million who served in World War II, 7.2 million who served during the Vietnam War era, and 3.9 million who have served in post-9/11 wars. Those numbers come from the VA’s National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics, which publishes [estimates and future-projections of the country’s veteran population](http://www.va.gov/vetdata/Veteran_Population.asp). You can explore the data by age, race, ethnicity, gender, military branch, state, county, era of service, and more. (To see the files, click on the “Population Tables” header.)

__Farmers in Africa.__ Between 2002 and 2004, researchers surveyed more than 9,500 farming households in 11 African countries to better understand how climate change might affect agricultural practices. Last month, they published the [detailed results and documentation in *Scientific Data*](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201620?WT.ec_id=SDATA-201605). The dataset includes responses to questions about plantings, harvests, yields, water sources, animal purchases, taxes paid, and much more.


__Income inequality, country-by-country.__ The United Nations University’s [World Income Inequality Database](https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/wiid-%E2%80%93-world-income-inequality-database) contains historical [Gini coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) for more than 170 countries — in some instances stretching back to the 1930s or ’40s. The [latest version of the database](https://www.wider.unu.edu/download/WIID3.3) was released in October 2015 and includes key details about each estimate, such as the name of the primary source and the quality of data collection.


__Speling chellange.__ The Scripps National Spelling Bee publishes the [competition’s results online](http://spellingbee.com/public/results/2016/round_results), but not in any analysis-friendly format. Thankfully, statistician [Christopher Long](http://angrystatistician.blogspot.com/) has [scraped and spreadsheet-ified](https://github.com/octonion/spelling) the Scripps results going back to 1996 – including last week’s finals. __Related:__ FiveThirtyEight uses the data to ask, “[Where Do Spelling Bee Words Come From?](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-do-spelling-bee-words-come-from/)”


__The LEGO-verse.__ [BrickLink](https://www.bricklink.com) is a website for buying and selling LEGOs. It also happens to publish [a (nearly?) complete inventory of every LEGO set and piece](https://www.bricklink.com/catalogDownload.asp) produced since 1949. __Related:__ LEGO sets have become increasingly violent, [according to a recent study](http://www.bartneck.de/publications/2016/legoViolence/index.html).
