__Health and nutrition.__ Since 1999, CDC [has been continuously fielding](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about_nhanes.htm) its [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm), interviewing and testing approximately 5,000 people in 15 different counties each year. The survey combines ‚Äúdemographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions‚Äù with an ‚Äúexamination component‚Äù involving ‚Äúmedical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel.‚Äù Its [public-access data files](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx) provide anonymized, respondent-level records and are currently available for surveys conducted through March 2020. __As seen in__: [Catherine McDonough et al.](https://publichealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e53330)‚Äôs [dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/10382740) and [interactive dashboard](https://rstudio-connect.hpc.mssm.edu/POND/) ‚Äúexploring factors associated with prediabetes and diabetes mellitus among youth in the United States.‚Äù


__Monthly crime trends.__ The [Real-Time Crime Index](https://realtimecrimeindex.com/), [launched last week](https://jasher.substack.com/p/the-real-time-crime-index-is-live) by a [team of crime-data analysts](https://www.ahdatalytics.com/about-us/), presents a ‚Äúsample of reported crime data from hundreds of law enforcement agencies nationwide which mimics national crime trends with as little lag and the most accuracy possible.‚Äù Framed as a [supplement to the FBI‚Äôs slow-to-update official statistics](https://realtimecrimeindex.com/how-does-this-work/), the project provides monthly and rolling 12-month totals of reported crimes (using the FBI‚Äôs [UCR Part I offense categories](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/offense-definitions)) for the nation, individual cities, and by city population size. You can [download the data](https://realtimecrimeindex.com/data/) and [see the sources for each of the 300+ local agencies](https://ah-datalytics.github.io/rtci/list/list.html) in the national sample. __Read more__: ‚Äú[The Real-Time Crime Index Shows Declining Crime in 2024](https://jasher.substack.com/p/the-real-time-crime-index-shows-declining),‚Äù from [project co-leader Jeff Asher‚Äôs newsletter](https://jasher.substack.com/).


__Source code.__ [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/), a nonprofit initiative [collaborating](https://web.archive.org/web/20230722080603/https://en.unesco.org/softwareheritage) with [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO), [maintains](https://www.softwareheritage.org/faq/) ‚Äúthe largest public collection of source code in existence‚Äù: an [archive](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/) tracking 20 billion source files and 4 billion code-commits from 317 million projects from a range of public software hosts ([GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), et cetera). Its [Graph Dataset](https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-dataset/graph/index.html#swh-graph-dataset), which provides access to the archive‚Äôs content and internal relationships, is available via [bulk downloads](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ctizzjwytj4sk#overview) and [APIs](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/api/#endpoint-index).

__Italian tax-to-charity allocations.__ Italy‚Äôs ‚Äúfive per thousand‚Äù program allows taxpayers to allocate 0.5% of their income tax to certain nonprofits, research institutions, and other social-benefit organizations. The country‚Äôs Ministry of Economy and Finance has [published information about 2022‚Äôs beneficiaries](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/elenco-complessivo-degli-enti-ammessi-in-una-o-piu-categorie-di-beneficiari), but [initially did so only via PDFs](https://web.archive.org/web/20240605153105/https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/elenco-complessivo-degli-enti-ammessi-in-una-o-piu-categorie-di-beneficiari). [Earlier this year](https://datibenecomune.substack.com/p/liberiamoli-tutti-numero-4), the [*Liberiamoli tutti!*](https://datibenecomune.substack.com/p/il-numero-zero) initiative [converted those PDFs into structured data](https://github.com/ondata/liberiamoli-tutti/tree/main/cinque_per_mille/dati) that list each recipient organization‚Äôs name, tax ID, category, region, province, and municipality, number of taxpayers choosing it, and amount of money allocated. The ministry has since added structured files of its own.


__Snakes.__ [SnakeDB](https://snakedb.org/) ‚Äî created by [Sascha Steinhoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sascha-steinhoff/) ‚Äúafter [he] accidentally stepped into a snake in South-East Asia‚Äù ‚Äî provides [downloadable data](https://snakedb.org/pages/about-snakedb.php) on the [maximum size](https://snakedb.org/pages/size-max.php), [fang position](https://snakedb.org/pages/dentition-species.php), [pupil shape](https://snakedb.org/pages/pupil-species.php), [mode of reproduction](https://snakedb.org/pages/reproduction-species.php), and [toxicity](https://snakedb.org/pages/ld50.php) of thousands of species, drawn from [a broad range of sources](https://snakedb.org/pages/ref-library.php). __As seen in__: [Oleksandra Oskyrko et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03079-5)‚Äôs [ReptTraits database](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/ReptTraits_a_comprehensive_database_of_ecological_traits_in_reptiles/24572683).
