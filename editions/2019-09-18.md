*Amazonian deforestation, state immigration laws, interstate relations, interconnecting roads, and dark-web screenshots.*

&nbsp;

**Amazonian deforestation.** Since 1988, Brazil’s [PRODES project](http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes) has been using satellite imagery to track clear-cutting in [the country’s Amazon basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaz%C3%B4nia_Legal). The government’s [TerraBrasilis web portal](http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/en/home-page/) provides [an interactive map](http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/app/map/deforestation?hl=en-us) and [downloads](http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/en/download-2/) of the data. Global Forest Watch also provides a [dataset of PRODES-detected deforestation](http://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/4160f715e12d46a98c989bdbe7e5f4d6_1), from 2001 to 2015.

**State immigration laws.** Political science professor [Jamie Monogan](https://spia.uga.edu/faculty-member/jamie-monogan/) [has compiled](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psj.12359) a dataset of [more than 2,700 immigration laws](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/F8YTX2) passed by US state legislatures from 2005 to 2016. The dataset summarizes the laws and also categorizes them by subject, scope, and whether they appear to be welcoming or hostile to immigrants.[h/t [Jason Anastasopoulos](https://twitter.com/jlanastas/status/1172327364056846336)]

&nbsp;

**How states relate.** The [State Networks dataset](https://ippsr.msu.edu/public-policy/state-networks) gathers comparative and relationship metrics for every combination of the 50 US states, plus the District of Columbia. Among the metrics: the number of flights between each state-pair, migration in either direction, and total value of goods imported. The comparisons also include state-to-state differences in demographics, ideology, and GDP. [h/t [Matt Grossmann](https://twitter.com/MattGrossmann/status/1171418973063303168)]

&nbsp;

**Interconnecting roads.** Urban planning professor [Geoff Boeing](https://geoffboeing.com/)’s [US street network data](https://geoffboeing.com/2019/03/us-street-network-models-measures/) represents America’s roads as a network graph, where each intersection (and dead-end) is a node, and each street segment is an edge between two of those nodes. The project’s [data repository](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CUWWYJ) contains these networks for each city, county, Census tract, and more. **You might remember:** [Boeing’s urban street orientation charts](https://geoffboeing.com/2019/09/urban-street-network-orientation/).

&nbsp;

**Dark-web screenshots.** [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/), Luxembourg’s computer security incident response team, has published a dataset of [37,500 .onion website screenshots](https://www.circl.lu/opendata/circl-ail-dataset-01/), a subset of which have been categorized by topic (e.g., “drugs-narcotics”, “extremism”, “finance”) and/or purpose (e.g., “forum”, “file-sharing”, “scam”).
