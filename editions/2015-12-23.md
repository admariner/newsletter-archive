Data Is Plural — 2015.12.23 edition
===================================

*“O CHRISTMAS TREE” EDITION: Emergency room visits, agricultural production, Wikipedia traffic, tree maps, and the emojiverse.*


__How America injures itself.__ Every year, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission tracks emergency rooms visits to approximately 100 hospitals. The commission uses the resulting [National Electronic Injury Surveillance System data](http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/) to estimate national injury statistics, but it also publishes anonymized information for each consumer product–related visit, including the [associated product code](http://www.cpsc.gov//Global/Neiss_prod/completemanual.pdf) (e.g., 1701: “Artificial Christmas trees”) and a short narrative (“71 YO WM FRACTURED HIP WHEN GOT DIZZY AND FELL TAKING DOWN CHRISTMAS TREE AT HOME”).


__Farm to data-table.__ The [USDA’s 2012 Census of Agriculture](http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/) — the most recent vintage available — tallies agricultural activity at the national, state, and county levels. You can download [detailed data from the agency’s Quick Stats tool](http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/?source_desc=CENSUS). In 2012, [Oregon harvested more Christmas trees](http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Full_Report/Volume_1,_Chapter_2_US_State_Level/st99_2_035_035.pdf) than any other state: 6.4 million of them, or 37% of the census total.


__Wikipedia traffic trends.__ The Wikimedia Foundation [publishes hourly pageview counts for each of its articles](http://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/pagecounts-raw/). It’s a tremendous amount of data — about 90 megabytes, compressed, per hour. Luckily, there’s also a [tool for browsing individual pages’ daily traffic stats](http://stats.grok.se/). Last Wednesday, the [English-language page for "Christmas tree"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree) [received 7,822 visits](http://stats.grok.se/en/latest90/Christmas_tree), its highest mark so far this year.


__Little’s big tree maps.__ The Forest Service has digitized many of the [tree species distribution maps from Elbert Little's “Atlas of United States Trees,”](http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/data/little/) first published in the 1970s. Shapefiles and PDFs are available for for more than 600 species — including *Ilex opaca* (American holly) and *Pseudotsuga menziesii* (Douglas fir).


__The emjoiverse.__ The Unicode Consortium publishes a [big ol’ HTML table of every emoji](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html), how they look in various contexts, and when they entered the canon. The “Christmas tree” emoji occupies code point U+1F384, and was introduced in 2010. (“Menorah with nine branches” arrived in 2015.)
