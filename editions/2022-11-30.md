__Pills.__ From its launch in 2009 until its [retirement last year](https://web.archive.org/web/20201021105954/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/ja20/ja20_pillbox_discontinue.html), the National Library of Medicine‚Äôs [Pillbox project](https://web.archive.org/web/20201021105954/https://pillbox.nlm.nih.gov/index.html) collected and created 8,600+ photographs of medical pills. The images, which are still [available to download](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pill_image.html), are [accompanied by a dataset](https://datadiscovery.nlm.nih.gov/Drugs-and-Chemicals/Pillbox-retired-January-28-2021-/crzr-uvwg) that provides information on 83,000+ pills‚Äô shape, size, color, markings, dosage, and other characteristics derived from drug labels. __Related__: The library‚Äôs [DailyMed service](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/) provides frequently-updated [images and data from 140,000+ labels](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/spl-resources.cfm) submitted to the FDA for [drugs and other regulated products](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/about-dailymed.cfm). __As seen in__: [Jon Keegan](https://mastodon.social/@jonkeegan)‚Äôs [Pillbox overview](https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/the-pillbox-database/) in [Beautiful Public Data](https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/).

__Per-pupil spending.__ The [National Education Resource Database on Schools](https://edunomicslab.org/nerds/) (‚Äú*NERD$*‚Äù) describes itself as the ‚Äúfirst-ever national dataset of public K-12 spending by school.‚Äù Its researchers, based at Georgetown University, aggregate and standardize the [expenditure disclosures](https://edunomicslab.org/2018/03/28/interstate-financial-reporting/) that the [Every Student Succeeds Act](https://www.ed.gov/ESSA/) requires states to publish. You can explore and download the data they‚Äôve processed for fiscal year 2019, including spending totals, enrollment counts, and normalized figures that facilitate cross-state comparisons. For 2020‚Äì22, you can access ‚Äúthe raw files we obtain from states while our team conducts validation checks and norms the data.‚Äù __As seen in__: ‚Äú[How much money do states spend on education?](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-much-money-do-states-spend-on-education/)‚Äù (USAFacts).

__Travelers‚Äô coronavirus variants.__ In the past year, the CDC‚Äôs [Traveler-Based Genomic Surveillance program](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-genomic-surveillance) has collected 60,000+ voluntary nasal swabs from people disembarking international flights at four major US airports. The agency uses the samples as an ‚Äúearly warning system‚Äù to detect emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and [publishes weekly metrics](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#traveler-genomic-surveillance) that include participation counts, positivity rates (per pooled sample), and variant distributions. __Read more__: [An interview with two private-industry experts working on the program](https://coviddatadispatch.com/2022/11/06/how-testing-international-travelers-helps-the-cdc-keep-tabs-on-new-variants/), by the [COVID-19 Data Dispatch](https://coviddatadispatch.com/)‚Äôs [Betsy Ladyzhets](https://betsyladyzhets.com/).


__Indonesia earthquake intensities.__ [Gempa Nusantara](https://github.com/7point1/GempaNusantara), a database compiled by [Martin et al.](https://doi.org/10.1785/0120220047), uses historical documents to catalog 7,300+ ‚Äúmacroseismic effects‚Äù of 1,200 earthquakes near Indonesia during four-century span, from 1546 to 1950. It provides summaries of the local reports and categorizes the effects according to the [European Macroseismic Scale](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/seismic-hazard-and-risk-dynamics/data-products-services/ems-98-european-macroseismic-scale/), which focuses on the intensity of ground-shaking and [potential impacts on buildings and terrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_macroseismic_scale).


__More roadkill.__ [Florian Heigl et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01599-6) have compiled a [pair](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/d0d5ef85-71b2-4da6-b6f6-c1c3d60987d3) of [datasets](https://zenodo.org/record/5878813) containing 15,000+ reports of vertebrate roadkill from 2014 to 2020, submitted by 900+ people [through a phone app](https://roadkill.at/en). The datasets differ in identification confidence, but both provide locations, dates, and taxonomic classifications. Although the records span 40+ countries, the majority come from Austria, where the project is [now focused](https://roadkill.at/en/about/faqsen). __Previously__: [Andean roadkill](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.xwdbrv1cp) ([DIP 2021.07.07](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-07-07-edition/)).
