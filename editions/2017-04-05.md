Data Is Plural — 2017.04.05 edition
===================================

*NYC in 3D, cherry blossoms, sovereign bond holdings, NSF grants, and avian invasions.*


__3D NYC.__ In 2014, the NYC Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications conducted a massive aerial survey of the city. Then, they converted the images and data they collected into [a three-dimensional model of every building in all five boroughs](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doitt/initiatives/3d-building.page). __Related:__ In December, *The New York Times* [used the data to map the city’s shadows](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/21/upshot/Mapping-the-Shadows-of-New-York-City.html). __Also related:__ [Berlin](http://www.businesslocationcenter.de/en/downloadportal), [the Hague](https://data.overheid.nl/data/dataset/3d-model-den-haag/resource/2191118b-5ccc-436b-a5f8-eca12f8f8281), and [Lyon](https://data.grandlyon.com/search/?Q=maquettes+textur%25C3%25A9es) offer digital 3D models of their cities, too. __Previously:__ [LiDAR-powered elevation data from around the world](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-05-25-edition) (May 25, 2016).

__Cherry blossoms.__ Yasuyuki Aono, an associate professor at Osaka Prefecture University, has collected the [historical flowering dates of Kyoto’s *Prunus jamasakura* cherry trees](http://atmenv.envi.osakafu-u.ac.jp/aono/kyophenotemp4/) going all the way back to the 9th century. The dataset is based on “many diaries and chronicles written by Emperors, aristocrats, [governors] and monks,” Aono writes. The dates are those “on which cherry blossom viewing parties had been held or full flowerings had been observed.” Over the past century, [Kyoto’s cherry trees have been blooming earlier and earlier](https://twitter.com/hausfath/status/848939887839526912). __Related:__ [@bbgblossoms](https://twitter.com/bbgblossoms), a Twitter bot that tracks the status of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden’s [152 cherry trees](https://www.bbg.org/collections/cherries).

__Government bond ownership.__ [Bruegel](http://bruegel.org/), “a European think tank that specialises in economics,” publishes a quarterly-updated dataset quantifying [sovereign bond holdings for 12 countries](http://bruegel.org/publications/datasets/sovereign-bond-holdings/): Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, the U.K., and the United States. For each country, the dataset tells you what proportion of the federal government’s bonds are held by each of five types of owners: the country’s central bank, other public institutions, domestic banks, other domestic investors, and foreign investors.

__Science grants.__ The National Science Foundation publishes data on [all of the grants the agency has awarded since the 1970s](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/download.jsp) (and some earlier ones, too). Each grant is represented as an XML file, which contains information about the project, the awardee, and the NSF division that awarded the grant. [h/t [France A. Córdova](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/a/10945)]


__Avian invasions.__ In [peer-reviewed paper published last week](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201741), a trio of University College London researchers describe their [Global Avian Invasions Atlas](https://figshare.com/articles/Data_from_The_Global_Avian_Invasions_Atlas_-_A_database_of_alien_bird_distributions_worldwide/4234850). The dataset includes information on “971 species, introduced to 230 countries and administrative areas across all eight biogeographical realms, spanning the period 6000 BCE – AD 2014.”
