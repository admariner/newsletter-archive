*Facilities handling hazardous chemicals, Animal Welfare Act inspections, daily European gas imports, unclaimed estates, and data journalists.*


__Facilities handling hazardous chemicals.__ The US Environmental Protection Agency’s [Risk Management Program rule](https://www.epa.gov/rmp/risk-management-program-rmp-rule-overview) requires facilities that handle “extremely hazardous substances” to tell the government, at least every five years, about those substances, their safety plans, their recent accident history, and more. Through a [FOIA request to the EPA](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/epa-risk-management-program/), the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/) ([which, disclosure, I run](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/about/)) obtained a copy of the agency’s database of these filings (minus some parts the government deems non-disclosable), containing submissions by 21,000+ facilities from early 1999 to February 2022. You can now [access that data](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/epa-risk-management-program-database/), in various formats, along with [documentation guiding you through it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jrLXtv0knnACiPXJ1ZRFXR1GaPWCHJWWjin4rsthFbQ/edit).


__Animal Welfare Act inspections.__ The USDA’s [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/) checks whether animal dealers, exhibitors, research facilities, and transporters are complying with the care standards set by the [Animal Welfare Act](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalwelfare/awa/ct_awa_program_information). The agency provides [public access to the inspection reports](https://efile.aphis.usda.gov/PublicSearchTool/s/inspection-reports) but no bulk data on them. So, in a [collaboration](https://biglocalnews.org/content/news/2023/02/21/usda-animal-inspection-database.html) between [Big Local News](https://biglocalnews.org/content/about/) and the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/) (same disclosure as above), [Ben Welsh](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/) and I [wrote code](https://github.com/data-liberation-project/aphis-inspection-reports/blob/main/METHODOLOGY.md) to fetch the 80,000+ (and counting) inspections going back to 2014, parse their PDFs, and [make the data more accessible](https://github.com/data-liberation-project/aphis-inspection-reports). The information includes each inspection’s date, type, licensee, violation counts, species inspected, and more.


__Daily European gas imports.__ Researchers at [Bruegel](https://www.bruegel.org/bruegel-european-think-tank-specialises-economics) are [tracking daily and weekly natural gas imports to Europe](https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/european-natural-gas-imports), using data from the [European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas](https://www.entsog.eu/)’s [transparency portal](https://transparency.entsog.eu/). Alongside the imports, which they’re aggregating by source (e.g., Russia, Norway, Algeria) and by route (e.g., Nord Stream, TurkStream), the researchers are also tracking [gas storage levels](https://agsi.gie.eu/), using data from [Gas Infrastructure Europe](https://www.gie.eu/) ([DIP 2022.01.26](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-01-26-edition/)). __Previously__: Eurostat’s data on annual European energy [imports](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/envir?lang=en&subtheme=nrg.nrg_quant.nrg_quanta.nrg_t.nrg_ti&display=list&sort=category&extractionId=NRG_TI_SFF__custom_2293925) and [exports](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/envir?lang=en&subtheme=nrg.nrg_quant.nrg_quanta.nrg_t.nrg_te&display=list&sort=category&extractionId=NRG_TI_SFF__custom_2293925) ([DIP 2022.03.16](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-03-16-edition/)).


__Unclaimed estates.__ The UK government’s [Bona Vacantia division](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/bona-vacantia) publishes a [dataset of unclaimed estates](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/unclaimed-estates-list) — inheritances that nobody has claimed yet to inherit. The entries indicate the deceased person’s name, aliases, date/place of birth and death, marital status, and more. __Related__: California provides a [dataset](https://sco.ca.gov/upd_download_property_records.html) of [unclaimed property](https://sco.ca.gov/upd_msg.html), such as “lost or forgotten” bank accounts, insurance benefits, and stock holdings.


__Data journalists, surveyed.__ The [European Journalism Center](https://ejc.net/)’s [DataJournalism.com](https://datajournalism.com/) has published a [dataset of 1,800+ anonymized responses](https://github.com/ejcnet/stateofdatajournalism2022) to its [second annual State of Data Journalism Survey](https://datajournalism.com/survey/2022/), including 50+ entries each from the US, UK, Italy, Germany, Spain, India, and Nigeria, plus double-digit counts from dozens of other countries. The questions touch on demographics, employment, training, skills, the COVID-19 pandemic, and more. [h/t [Simona Bisiani](https://twitter.com/BisianiSimona)]
