===================================

*Manufacturing, county-level health care, macro-financial history, farmers markets, and readers like you.*


__American manufacturing.__ The Census Bureau’s [Annual Survey of Manufacturers](http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/asm.html) provides state-by-state and industry-by-industry statistics for America’s manufacturing sector. Metrics include the number of employees, annual payroll, “value added,” beginning-of-year inventory, and many more. In 2014, dog and cat food manufacturers employed about 18,000 people nationwide. __Related:__ “[Why Are Politicians So Obsessed With Manufacturing?](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/magazine/why-are-politicians-so-obsessed-with-manufacturing.html)” [h/t [Scott Stern](https://twitter.com/sstern_mit/status/786974010911428608) + [RJ Andrews](https://twitter.com/infowetrust/status/786971887653924864)]


__County-level health care.__ Each year, the Department of Health and Human Services updates its [Area Health Resources Files](http://ahrf.hrsa.gov/index.htm), a vast suite of local health care data collated from more than 50 sources. Among the topics covered: the number health care professionals by specialty, various rates of hospital usage, air quality, and demographic profiles. You can [download the data](http://ahrf.hrsa.gov/download.htm), or [explore](http://ahrf.hrsa.gov/arfdashboard/HRCT.aspx) and [map](http://ahrf.hrsa.gov/arfdashboard/ArfGeo.aspx) it online.

__Global financial history.__ The [Jordà-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory Database](http://www.macrohistory.net/data/) claims to be “the most extensive long-run macro-financial dataset to date.” It contains dozens of variables — GDP per capita, long-term interest rates, and the timing of systemic financial crises, for example — for 17 “advanced economies”. The dataset uses a Creative Commons license and has been extensively documented.


__8,675 farmers markets.__ The Department of Agriculture publishes a spreadsheet of [farmers markets in the United States](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/farmers-markets-geographic-data). For each market, the dataset notes its location, hours, and the types of goods available (e.g., vegetables, seafood, flowers, et cetera).

__Readers like you.__ Today’s newsletter marks the 50th edition of Data Is Plural, as well as its one-year anniversary. To celebrate, I’ve started publishing [a spreadsheet that details each edition’s basic stats](https://github.com/data-is-plural/newsletter-stats#data-is-plural-newsletter-stats) — total subscribers, the “open rate,” the number of people who chose to unsubscribe, and more.


*A special newsletter-birthday shoutout to my editors, [Nadja Popovich](https://twitter.com/popovichn) and [Mark Schoofs](https://twitter.com/schoofsfeed), who keep me in check :^)*
