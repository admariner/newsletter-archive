*Beneficial owners, administrative boundaries, legislative limits on teaching, Census tract population changes, and Bryan’s whistle-stop tour.*


__Beneficial owners.__ [Open Ownership](https://www.openownership.org/), a nonprofit aiming to improve “transparency over who owns and controls companies,” [works](https://www.openownership.org/en/about/what-we-do/) directly [with countries to implement reforms](https://www.openownership.org/en/map/) and has developed a [standard format for publishing such information](https://standard.openownership.org/). It also runs the [Open Ownership Register](https://register.openownership.org/), a database identifying the [beneficial owners](https://standard.openownership.org/en/latest/primer/whatisbo.html) of [8.4 million companies so far](https://twitter.com/OpenOwnership/status/1552975083811004416), drawn primarily from [records published by Denmark, Slovakia, the UK, and Ukraine](https://register.openownership.org/data_sources). You can search, [download](https://register.openownership.org/download), and [query](https://bods-data.openownership.org/source/register) those records, which include the companies’ names, addresses, and other details, as well as the owners’ names, nationalities, and interests in those companies.

__Administrative boundaries.__ The [geoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/) project, maintained by the [William & Mary geoLab](https://geolab.wm.edu/) and [volunteer contributors](https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries/graphs/contributors) since 2017, calls itself “the world’s largest open, free and research-ready database of political administrative boundaries.” It provides [an API](https://www.geoboundaries.org/api.html) and [downloadable datasets](https://www.geoboundaries.org/index.html#getdata) of those boundaries at up to six levels per country, ranging from the entire nation to progressively smaller entities — outlining, for instance, approximately 650,000 villages in India and 2,900 Portuguese [freguesias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freguesia). __Previously__: [The Database of Global Administrative Areas](https://gadm.org/) ([DIP 2019.07.17](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-07-17-edition/)) and [national borders from 1886 to 2019](https://icr.ethz.ch/data/cshapes/) ([DIP 2022.03.23](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-03-23-edition/)).


__Legislative limits on teaching.__ A [PEN America report](https://pen.org/report/Americas-censored-classrooms/) released last week examines recent developments in “educational gag orders,” which it defines as “state legislative efforts to restrict teaching about topics such as race, gender, American history, and LGBTQ+ identities in K–12 and higher education.” The study follows an [initial report published in November 2021](https://pen.org/report/educational-gag-orders/) and is supplemented by a [weekly-updated spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tj5WQVBmB6SQg-zP_M8uZsQQGH09TxmBY73v23zpyr0/edit#gid=1505554870) that describes and tracks successful, failed, and pending bills since January 2021.

__Census tract population changes.__ Researchers at the University of Tennessee [have built](https://tnsdc.utk.edu/2022/05/16/new-interactive-map-details-population-change-across-us-last-decade/) a [dataset](https://myutk.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=dfb01c34015d4e149dcbbf3fbbdfc88b) and [interactive map](https://myutk.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/sidebar/index.html?appid=b6cf315a28aa4089873ee3442d4a2597) comparing each US Census tract’s population in 2020 versus 2010. Because the Census Bureau routinely adds and modifies tracts between decennial surveys, the team used [geographic “crosswalk” files from the National Historic Geographic Information System](https://www.nhgis.org/geographic-crosswalks) to [make the comparisons](https://tnsdc.utk.edu/2022/05/16/producing-maps-of-detailed-population-change-between-2010-and-2020/).

__Bryan’s whistle-stop tour.__ In 1896, Democratic Party presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan [took four key campaign trips via rail](https://railroads.unl.edu/views/item/bryan_speech), giving speeches in hundreds of cities along the way. The [Railroads and the Making of Modern America](https://railroads.unl.edu/) project, based at the University of Nebraska, has compiled a [table of those itineraries](https://railroads.unl.edu/topics/bryanTriplog1896.php?trip=all); it lists each event’s date and location and links to many of the speeches. __As seen in__: “[Do Local Campaign Visits by a Populist Politician Matter in Elections?](https://broadstreet.blog/2022/07/15/do-local-campaign-visits-by-a-populist-politician-matter-in-elections/)” ([Johannes Buggle](http://www.johannesbuggle.com/) and [Stephanos Vlachos](http://www.stephanosvlachos.com/)).
