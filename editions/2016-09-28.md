Data Is Plural — 2016.09.28 edition
===================================

*🇺🇸  Election edition.🇺🇸*

&nbsp;

**State-level results.** Perhaps better known for its campaign-finance data, the Federal Election Commission also publishes official [state-level results for presidential, House, and Senate elections](http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/electionresults.shtml) going back to 1982. The results include all official candidates, and sometimes even write-ins (depending on the state). In the 2008 presidential election, eight Rhode Island voters wrote-in “Stephen Colbert,” five scribbled “Joe the Plumber,” and seven chose “Jesus.”

&nbsp;

**County-level and precinct-level results.** [OpenElections](http://www.openelections.net/), a Knight Foundation–funded project, aims “[to create the first free, comprehensive, standardized, linked set of election data for the United States](http://openelections.net/about/).” They’ve made progress, but are [looking for additional volunteers](http://openelections.net/get-involved/). In the meantime, you can download county-level presidential results from the National Atlas of the United States for [2004](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2004-presidential-general-election-county-results-direct-download), [2008](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2008-presidential-general-election-county-results-direct-download), and [2012](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/presidential-general-election-results-2012-direct-download) — or [all combined](https://github.com/helloworlddata/us-presidential-election-county-results). And you can download [precinct-level results from 2002 to 2012](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/21919) from the [Harvard Election Data Archive](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/eda/) ([codebook here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/156214/heda_docs.pdf)).

**Ways and means.** The [U.S. Election Assistance Commission](http://www.eac.gov/)’s [Election Administration and Voting Survey](http://www.eac.gov/research/election_administration_and_voting_survey.aspx) “includes data on the ability of civilian, military and overseas citizens to register to vote and successfully cast a ballot,” as well as an overview of each state’s voting laws and procedures.

**Global elections.** The [Constituency-Level Elections Archive](http://www.electiondataarchive.org/), based at the University of Michigan, collects and standardizes results from lower-house legislative elections around the world. (In the U.S., the lower house is the House of Representatives; in the U.K., it’s the House of Commons; in Albania, it’s the *Kuvendi i Shqipërisë*.) The [latest release](http://www.electiondataarchive.org/datacenter.html) covers 1,591 elections from 136 countries. [h/t [Jeremy Darrington](http://libguides.princeton.edu/elections/foreign)]

**Bush v. Gore v. hanging chads.** After 2000’s contentious election, the National Opinion Research Center — [funded by a consortium of news organizations](http://www.electionstudies.org/florida2000/sponsors.htm) — [rigorously reviewed 175,010 Florida ballots](http://www.electionstudies.org/florida2000/index.htm) that weren’t recognized as “valid” votes for president. In November 2001 the researchers concluded that, even with a full recount of disputed ballots, [George W. Bush still would have won the state by 493 votes](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/12/us/examining-vote-overview-study-disputed-florida-ballots-finds-justices-did-not.html). The [underlying data](http://www.electionstudies.org/florida2000/data/data_files.htm) is available in several formats.
