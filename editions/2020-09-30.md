Data Is Plural — 2020.09.30 edition
===================================

*State bills, centuries of federal debt, the Global Wind Atlas, the Social Connectedness Index, and prime numbers.*


__State bills.__ For years, [Open States](https://openstates.org/) has allowed you to “track bills, review upcoming legislation, and see how your local representatives are voting in your state.” The [volunteer-driven project](https://openstates.org/about/) provides [bulk downloads](https://openstates.org/data/) of nearly all its data, plus [an API](https://docs.openstates.org/en/latest/api/v2/). More recently, it has started [tracking coronavirus-related legislation](https://openstates.org/covid19/), with data on more than 3,300 bills across the country.

__Centuries of federal debt.__ The US Treasury’s “[Debt to the Penny](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny)” dataset reports the total amount of outstanding public debt issued by the federal government — updated daily and going back to April 1, 1993. As of Monday, that number was $26,811,409,726,497.33. Another of [the Treasury’s datasets](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/) provides [*annual* debt figures going back to 1789](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/historical-debt-outstanding/historical-debt-outstanding).

__Wind.__ The [Global Wind Atlas](https://globalwindatlas.info/) aims “to help policymakers, planners, and investors identify high-wind areas for wind power generation virtually anywhere in the world.” The internationally-funded project provides a range of [global and country-specific datasets](https://globalwindatlas.info/downloads/gis-files), including wind speeds at various heights, as well as a [description of its methodology](https://globalwindatlas.info/about/method) and an [FAQ](https://globalwindatlas.info/about/faq).

__Cross-border friendliness.__ The [Social Connectedness Index](https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/social-connectedness-index/), a collaboration between Facebook and academic researchers, quantifies “the intensity of connectedness between locations” by measuring the frequency of Facebook-friendships linking their residents. The index represents this measurement on a scale from 1 to 1,000,000,000; the [publicly available datasets](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/social-connectedness-index) provide it for every pair of countries, every pair of US counties, every county-country pair, and between subnational regions around the world. __Related__: [An illustrative Twitter thread demonstrating the data](https://twitter.com/stroebel_econ/status/1247537135487299590).

__Prime numbers.__ Mathematician [Chris K. Caldwell](https://www.utm.edu/staff/caldwell/) maintains a [searchable](https://primes.utm.edu/primes/search.php), [downloadable](https://primes.utm.edu/primes/download.php) database of [the largest prime numbers known to humankind](https://primes.utm.edu/primes/home.php) — plus who discovered them, when, and how. __Related__: [Smaller primes](https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/).
