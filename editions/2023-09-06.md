__Eponymic streets.__ [Mapping Diversity](https://mappingdiversity.eu/), created by the [European Data Journalism Network](https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/), ‚Äúis a platform for discovering key facts about diversity and representation in street names across Europe, and to spark a debate about who is missing from our urban spaces.‚Äù The interactive analysis of 145,000+ streets in 30 major European cities launched in March, accompanied by [spreadsheets](https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/cp_dataset/street-names-in-european-cities/) calculating city-level statistics and listing all the streets named after women. Last month the team [released](https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/cp_data_news/mapping-diversity-full-dataset-release/) its [full dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xBc8EcR2jR2senxMpgIRFE0jafMn23sM), which provides information for every street examined, plus data for six more cities. Each row indicates a street‚Äôs country, city, and name; whether it‚Äôs named after anyone; and, if so, the person‚Äôs name, gender, and various attributes from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/), such as occupation and date of birth. __Previously__: [Las Calles de las Mujeres](https://geochicasosm.github.io/lascallesdelasmujeres/) ([DIP 2019.05.29](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-05-29-edition/)).


__Doctors in practice.__ The [Physician and Physician Practice Research Database](https://www.ahrq.gov/data/innovations/3p-rd.html), published by the US government‚Äôs [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality](https://www.ahrq.gov/), harmonizes data on medical practices from 13 participating states. The public-use files provide each practice‚Äôs ZIP code, number of physicians, most common specialty, organizational [NPI](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Administrative-Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand), and other characteristics. They also provide statistical aggregates at the 3-digit ZIP code level, such as the number of physicians accepting Medicare and/or Medicaid, average claims per month, and more.

__Intra-state ceasefires.__ [Govinda Clayton et al.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00220027221129183)‚Äôs  [Civil Conflict Ceasefire Dataset](https://ceasefireproject.org/download/) ‚Äúcovers all ceasefires in civil conflict between 1989 and 2020, including multilateral, bilateral and unilateral arrangements, ranging from verbal arrangements to detailed written agreements.‚Äù The dataset‚Äôs 2,200+ ceasefires span 109 conflicts in 66 countries, largely based on news articles discussing the agreements. A team of reviewers manually coded each instance, indicating its type and stated purpose; sides participating; dates declared, entered effect, and ended; and more. __Previously__: [The PA-X Peace Agreements Database](https://www.peaceagreements.org/) ([DIP 2018.02.28](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-02-28-edition/)).


__Metabolisms.__ Drawing on 20+ published sources, [Tori M. Hoehler et al.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2303764120) have compiled a [dataset of 10,000+ measurements](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2303764120#supplementary-materials) of metabolic rates of mammals, fish, birds, insects, tree saplings, bacteria, and other living organisms. The dataset includes several types of metabolic rates (primarily [basal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate), field, and maximum), and a mix of individual-organism and species-average measurements. 


__Vox populi, except not.__ [The Onion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Onion) runs a regular feature called ‚Äú[American Voices](https://www.theonion.com/opinion/american-voices),‚Äù which presents fake quotes from fake people responding to not-fake events in the news. [Cody Winchester](https://codywinchester.com/) has [built](https://codywinchester.com/the-onion-american-voices/) a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kPvF9_zZ375JKr0ATguQwUMXYDYi23HBkzu3uLUw_R8/edit) listing the headlines, descriptions, and dates for 7,000+ of these features since August 1996; the 23,000+ quotes in them; and the names, occupations, and (almost always recycled) photos of the fictional personae purportedly quoted.
