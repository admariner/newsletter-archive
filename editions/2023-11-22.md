===================================

*Food access, strategic ecology, Australian law, electricity-balancing incentives, and lunar craters.*


*üéô The [Data Is Plural podcast](https://podcast.data-is-plural.com/) is back, with a new season of 15-minute interviews that dive deeper into DIP-noted datasets. Season 2‚Äôs first guests are [Jan Diehm](http://jandiehmdesigns.com/) and [Amber Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amberrthomas/), whose [data-driven investigation into pocket sizes](https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/) was featured in [DIP 2018.08.22](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-08-22-edition/).

Charts show how rare that is](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2023/california-new-city-rare/)‚Äù ‚Äî an article published by reader Nami Sumida in the San Francisco Chronicle last week ‚Äî uses [Christopher B. Goodman](https://cgoodman.com/)‚Äôs [municipal incorporation dataset](https://github.com/cbgoodman/muni-incorporation) featured in [DIP 2023.03.22](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-03-22-edition/).

__Food access.__ The USDA‚Äôs [Food Access Research Atlas](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/) estimates how far people have to travel to buy healthy groceries. For any given Census tract, the project‚Äôs [interactive map](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/go-to-the-atlas/) and [downloadable data](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/download-the-data/) indicate the number of residents living within 0.5, 1, 10, and 20 miles of ‚Äúthe nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store.‚Äù They provide similar counts for each tract‚Äôs low-income residents, children, seniors, people without vehicle access, [SNAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program) recipients, and by race/ethnicity. The most recent update [uses 2019 data](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2021/june/updated-food-access-research-atlas-now-maps-changes-in-low-income-and-low-supermarket-access-areas-in-2019/); prior versions are available for 2015 and 2010. __Related__: The distances are [based partly](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/documentation/) on the USDA‚Äôs [database of SNAP-authorized retailers](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/retailer-locator).

__Strategic ecology.__ The [National Ecological Observatory Network](https://www.neonscience.org/) operates [81 study sites](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/explore-field-sites) across the US, [strategically selected](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/about-field-sites) to represent a diversity of ‚Äúvegetation, landforms, and ecosystem dynamics.‚Äù Examples include [Caribou Creek](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/cari) in Alaska, [Lyndon B. Johnson National Grassland](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/clbj) in Texas, and [Guanica Forest](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/guan) in Puerto Rico. The network‚Äôs [data portal](https://www.neonscience.org/data) provides [downloads](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/explore) and an [API](https://data.neonscience.org/data-api/) for 160+ datasets, such as [site elevations](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30024.001), [downed wood log surveys](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10010.001), [soil microbe compositions](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10081.001), and [fish DNA sequences](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.20105.001). __Related__: [Ben G. Weinstein et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.25.563626v1) recently [used the network‚Äôs remote sensing data](https://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2023/11/13/data-on-100-million-individual-trees-in-the-national-ecological-observatory-network/) to [generate](https://github.com/weecology/DeepTreeAttention/tree/species_release) a [dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/10067302) estimating the location, size, likely species, and status of 100 million individual trees at 24 of the sites.

__Australian law.__ In a [recent blog post](https://umarbutler.com/how-i-built-the-largest-open-database-of-australian-law/), [Umar Butler](https://umarbutler.com/) describes the process of building the [Open Australian Legal Corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/umarbutler/open-australian-legal-corpus), ‚Äúfrom months-long negotiations with governments to reverse engineering ancient web technologies to hacking together a multitude of different solutions for extracting text from documents.‚Äù The corpus, ‚Äúthe largest open database of Australian law,‚Äù lists the text, type, jurisdiction, source, citation, and URL of 220,000+ documents. It includes ‚Äúevery in force statute and regulation in the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and Norfolk Island, in addition to thousands of bills and hundreds of thousands of court and tribunal decisions.‚Äù [h/t [Susie Cambria](https://www.facebook.com/susiecambria/)]


__Electricity-balancing incentives.__ [Jim Moran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdmoran/)‚Äôs [VPP Data](https://www.vppdata.com/p/vpp-data) tracks programs in the US that incentivize homeowners (and others) to participate in [virtual power plants](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/doe-releases-new-report-pathways-commercial-liftoff-virtual-power-plants) ‚Äî collections of internet-connected batteries and other ‚Äúdistributed energy resources‚Äù that utilities can use to balance supply and demand. The project‚Äôs [main spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y8epdlr_7npoJBwKd5A3CDpxoYaYY1xI38btHpOn2tw/edit#gid=0) tracks 120+ programs and their variations, spanning 20+ states and Puerto Rico. Each entry lists the program name, date announced, status, state, utility, sector, VPP platform, market aggregator, devices covered, monetary incentives, and more.


__Moon dents.__ The [Lunar Crater Database](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Moon/Research/Craters/lunar_crater_database_robbins_2018), [compiled by Stuart Robbins](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018JE005592), provides the location and dimensions of 1.3 million lunar impact craters. The catalog, ‚Äúmanually identified and measured‚Äù from lunar orbiter imagery, is ‚Äúapproximately complete for all craters larger than about 1‚Äì2 km in diameter.‚Äù __Related__: [Craters on Venus, Ganymede, and Callisto](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/scientific-databases/), from the [Lunar and Planetary Institute](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/about/). __Previously__: [A 1:5,000,000-scale map of Earth‚Äôs moon](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Moon/Geology/Unified_Geologic_Map_of_the_Moon_GIS_v2) ([DIP 2021.12.08](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-12-08-edition/)).
