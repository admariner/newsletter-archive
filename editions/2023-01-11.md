*üì£ __Ad:__ Will your 2023 include a project that needs geocoding? Check out OpenCage‚Äôs [geocoding buyer‚Äôs guide](https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services?ocs=dip) to learn all the factors to consider when deciding on which geocoding service to use, and thus avoid ‚ÄúI wish I had known that before we started.‚Äù*


__Automobile recalls.__ In the US, the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www.nhtsa.gov/) oversees all recalls of vehicles, tires, child safety seats, and other auto equipment. Through the agency‚Äôs [recall portal](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls), you can search by [vehicle identification number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number), make, model, and year; for other types of recalls, you can search by brand and model. The agency also provides a [dataset of all 26,000+ recalls since 1966](https://datahub.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Recalls-Data/6axg-epim). It lists the recall type, manufacturer‚Äôs name, component, number of units potentially affected, and date the manufacturer notified NHTSA, plus descriptions of the problem, recall action, and remedy.

__Small-business loans.__ The US Small Business Administration publishes [loan-level data from two of its major lending programs](https://data.sba.gov/dataset/7-a-504-foia), known as [7(a)](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/7a-loans) and [504](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/504-loans), going back to the early 1990s. The records, updated quarterly, indicate each loan‚Äôs amount, term, interest rate, approval date, and current status; borrower type, name, and location; bank name and location; and more. __As seen in__: The [Black Wealth Data Center](https://blackwealthdata.org/)‚Äôs [business ownership indicators](https://blackwealthdata.org/explore/business). __Previously__: [SBA data](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program/ppp-data) on loans provided through the pandemic-instigated [Paycheck Protection Program](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program) ([DIP 2020.07.08](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-07-08-edition/)).


__European Parliamentarians.__ Political scientist [Eugenio Salvati](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eugenio-Salvati) has [created](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14789299221135239) a dataset of [all European Parliament members](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/V2FJEF) who‚Äôve held office for at least one month since 1979, the EU legislative body‚Äôs first year of direct elections. For each five-year cycle, Salvati‚Äôs spreadsheets list each member‚Äôs name, country, gender, parliament role, [EP political group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_groups_of_the_European_Parliament), local political party, previous political experience, and more. Entries for the 2019‚Äì2024 cohort also indicate committee membership. __Previously__: [LobbyFacts.eu](https://www.lobbyfacts.eu/) ([DIP 2017.08.02](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-08-02-edition/)).


__Star light, star bright.__ A [variable star](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/senior/astrophysics/variable_types.html) is one whose brightness appears (from Earth) to vary over time. The [American Association of Variable Star Observers](https://www.aavso.org/), founded in 1911, maintains a [database](https://www.aavso.org/aavso-international-database-aid) of ‚Äútens of millions variable star observations going back over one hundred years,‚Äù making it ‚Äúthe largest and most comprehensive digital variable star database of its kind in the world.‚Äù You can download star details from the association‚Äôs [star index](https://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php), and also [download any given star‚Äôs set of observations](https://www.aavso.org/data-download).

__NYC pizza slices.__ ‚ÄúStarting in 2014, I logged every slice of pizza I ate in New York City on the Instagram account [NYC Slice](https://www.instagram.com/nycslice/),‚Äù writes reporter [Liam Quigley](https://elkue.com/), who [has published](https://elkue.com/nyc-slice/) a map, price chart, searchable table, and [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EY3oi9ttxybG0A0Obtwey6BFu7QLqdHe02JApijgztg/edit) of the first 464 slices. The data include each slice‚Äôs date, location, style, and price. ‚ÄúI did not rate the slices to avoid controversy and bribes. The biggest thing I have noticed is the decline in the amount of sauce put on slices.‚Äù
