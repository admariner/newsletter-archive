Data Is Plural — 2015.12.02 edition
===================================

*Historical climate data, mass shootings, faster open-data downloads, college sports financing, and celebrity faces.*


__Historical climate data.__ The [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) maintains more than 20 petabytes of data, it says. Among the most useful slices is the [Global Historical Climatology Network’s data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn), which aggregates reports on temperature, precipitation, wind, and more from [tens of thousands of climate-monitoring stations](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JTECH-D-11-00103.1) around the world. One tidbit: January 1995 was Death Valley’s wettest month since at least the 1960s, with a whopping 2.59 inches of precipitation.


__Mass shootings in America.__ [ShootingTracker.com provides datasets listing all U.S. mass shootings](http://shootingtracker.com/wiki/Main_Page) — defined as  “when four or more people are shot in an event, or related series of events” — since 2013. So far in 2015, mass shootings have killed 447 people and wounded an additional 1,292.


__A faster way to download open data.__ [Socrata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrata)’s software powers open-data portals around the world. But downloading large datasets — e.g., [this 2.8-gigabyte dataset of NYC parking tickets](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2015/c284-tqph) — from Socrata-powered portals can feel, well, sluggish. One solution: [OpenDataCache.com](http://www.opendatacache.com/), a free website that provides faster-to-download versions of virtually every dataset from 50+ Socrata portals.

__College sports financing.__ The Huffington Post and Chronicle of Higher Education teamed up to investigate [how colleges bankroll their athletics](http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/projects/ncaa/sports-at-any-cost). (Georgia State, for example, [spent more than $100 million subsidizing sports between 2010 and 2014](http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/projects/ncaa/subsidy-scorecards/eastern-kentucky-university), mostly via student fees.) The report, published last week, draws on five years of revenue/expense reports from 234 Division I public universities. You can [download the raw data](http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/ncaa/reporters-note) or [explore it online](http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/projects/ncaa/subsidy-scorecards). Related: The Washington Post also tackled this topic — from a slightly different angle — last week, [examining the profitability (or lack thereof) of athletic programs at 48 schools](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/sports/wp/2015/11/23/running-up-the-bills/).

__Celebrity faces, annotated.__ The [CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html), published in September, contains 200,000+ images of 10,000+ celebrities, each annotated with 40 yes/no variables. Some favorites: “5\_o\_Clock\_Shadow,” “Bags\_Under\_Eyes,” and “Goatee.”
