Data Is Plural — 2016.02.17 edition
===================================

*Risky behavior, emotion-tinged words, land cover, chess games, and dead insects.*

&nbsp;

**The kids are alright.** Every two years since 1991, the CDC has conducted the [Youth Risk Behavior Survey](http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/overview.htm), which asks high school students questions about drug use, sex, eating habits, and more. The [results are available](http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/data.htm) at the national, state, and district level. Results from the 2015 survey will be published in June, the CDC says. **Related:** [Today’s teens \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ less than you did](http://www.vox.com/a/teens).

**Word-emotion associations.** Computational linguists at Canada’s [National Research Council](http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/) used Mechanical Turk to crowdsource [the emotional associations of 14,182 words](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm). For each word, participants were asked whether it was “positive” and/or “negative”, and whether it was associated with any of eight emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. The resulting Word-Emotion Association Lexicon was first published in 2010. Of the full lexicon, only two words — “treat” and “feeling” — were associated with all eight emotions.

**The United States of Land.** In 2011, [agriculture occupied about 22% of all land](http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd11_stat.php) in the contiguous U.S., according to the [National Land Cover Database](http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd2011.php). The NLCD classifies every 30-meter-by-30-meter chunk of land into one of [16 categories](http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd11_leg.php), including “woody wetlands,” “cultivated crops,” and “developed” land, at different intensities. (Alaska’s unique landscape has earned it a few additional categories, such as “dwarf scrub.”) The database is presented as raster files, so you’ll need some geospatial software to dig in.

**Hundreds of thousands of chess games.** Portable Game Notation, a file format used to describe chess matches, [was invented in 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation). Since then, enthusiasts have created PGN files for virtually all top players’ games and every high-level tournament at sites such as [PGN Mentor](http://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html#events) and [Chess DB](http://chess-db.com/public/grandmasters.jsp).

**A quarter-million bugs.** For 18 years, a trap on the roof of the University of Copenhagen’s Zoological Museum [lured moths, butterflies, and beetles to their early deaths](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12452/full). Researchers at the university [counted and identified more than 250,000 specimens](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.s4945/1) from 1,500+ species. The most common: *Yponomeuta evonymella*, a moth species also known as the [bird-cherry ermine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird-cherry_ermine), which got trapped nearly 40,000 times.
