===================================

*China’s projects abroad, radio/TV broadcast areas, street sprawl, cannabis tests, and backyard ice rinks.*

&nbsp;

**China’s projects abroad.** The [AidData research lab](https://www.aiddata.org/about) at the College of William & Mary has published several datasets on China’s international soft-power efforts, including the [first-ever](https://www.aiddata.org/blog/aiddata-releases-first-ever-global-dataset-on-chinas-development-spending-spree) dataset of [government-financed development projects abroad](https://www.aiddata.org/data/geocoded-chinese-global-official-finance-dataset) (covering 3,485 projects between 2000 and 2014) and a structured dataset of [diplomacy efforts in 25 Asia/Pacific countries](https://www.aiddata.org/data/chinas-public-diplomacy-dashboard-dataset-version-1-0) between 2000 and 2016. [h/t [Nick Routley](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/global-chinese-financing-is-fueling-megaprojects) + [Simon Kuestenmacher](https://twitter.com/simongerman600/status/1216764349026574337)]

**Broadcast geography.** To construct her maps “[visualizing the geography of FM radio](https://erdavis.com/2020/01/04/visualizing-the-geography-of-fm-radio/)” in the US, [Erin Davis](https://erdavis.com/about/) combined the Federal Communication Commission’s [service contour data](https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/fm-service-contour-data-points) — the area where reception for a station “is generally protected from interference caused by other stations” — with the agency’s [radio station licensing data](https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/fm-query) and genre information from [radio-locator.com](https://radio-locator.com). The FCC also provides [service contour data for broadcast television](https://www.fcc.gov/media/television/tv-service-contour-data-points). **Previously**: [All FCC-issued licenses](http://reboot.fcc.gov/license-view/) ([DIP 2016.09.07](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-09-07-edition)).

&nbsp;

**Street sprawl.** Using 46 million kilometers of [data from OpenStreetMap](https://planet.openstreetmap.org), [Christopher Barrington-Leigh](https://wellbeing.ihsp.mcgill.ca) and [Adam Millard-Ball](https://people.ucsc.edu/~adammb/) have [published](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223078) “the first systematic and globally commensurable measures of street-network sprawl based on graph-theoretic and geographic concepts.” You can explore their findings via an [interactive map](https://sprawlmap.org/) and also download [aggregate metrics](https://sprawl.research.mcgill.ca/publications/2020-PNAS-sprawl/website-FAQ.html) for nearly 200 cities and more than 160 countries.

**Cannabis tests.** Despite US adults increasingly gaining state-legal access to cannabis, “no universal standards for laboratory testing protocols currently exist,” write [Nick Jikomes](https://twitter.com/trikomes) and [Michael Zoorob](https://michaelzoorob.com/about/), in a [March 2018 article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22755-2) for *Scientific Reports*. “To investigate these concerns, we analyzed a publicly available seed-to-sale traceability dataset from Washington state containing measurements of the cannabinoid content of legal cannabis products from state-certified laboratories.” The [dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/E8TQSD), obtained by the authors via public records requests, includes more than 200,000 test results over the course of three years.

&nbsp;

**Backyard ice rinks.** [RinkWatch](https://www.rinkwatch.org/) “asks people who love outdoor skating to help environmental scientists monitor winter weather conditions” by reporting the conditions of their backyard ice rinks. The project’s [downloadable data](https://www.rinkwatch.org/download.html) includes more than 30,000 “skateable” / “not skateable” observations of more than 1,200 rinks since 2012. **As mentioned in**: [Last week’s New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/travel/ice-skating-Quebec.html) about outdoor skating trails in Quebec.
