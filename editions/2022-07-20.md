*New voting laws, notable people, budget apportionments, digital trade provisions, and the World Cup.*


__New voting laws.__ The [Voting Rights Lab](https://votingrightslab.org/) has been [tracking 2,000+ laws proposed in US state legislatures](https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/pending/search) since 2021. The tracker focuses on “12 major issue areas relating to voter access and representation,” such as early voting, same-day registration, and ID requirements. It lists each bill’s state, number, author, date introduced, current status, and issue areas, plus a summary and the lab’s “assessment of whether the legislation is likely to improve or interfere with voter access or the administration of elections.” __As seen in__: “[Has Your State Made It Harder To Vote?](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/voting-restrictions-by-state/)” (FiveThirtyEight) __Related__: [States Newsroom](https://statesnewsroom.com/about/)’s [Kira Lerner](https://twitter.com/kira_lerner/status/1547630451140882434) has [compiled](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/criminalizing-vote-gop-led-states-enacted-102-new-election-penalties-after-2020) a [spreadsheet of 120 new election-related criminal penalties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wtN6RpLW_-g1gBYwWd5HaYiL6MtmG_nwC6kpIhzickU/edit#gid=0), based partly on the tracker’s data.


__Notable people.__ “A new strand of literature aims at building the most comprehensive and accurate database of notable individuals,” observe [Morgane Laouenan et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01369-4), who contribute a “cross-verified database of 2.29 million individuals” mined from Wikidata and the English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Swedish editions of Wikipedia. For each person, the [dataset](https://data.sciencespo.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.21410/7E4/RDAG3O) provides their birth and death dates, gender, citizenship, occupations, and other details. __Previously__: [The MIT-based Pantheon dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201575) ([DIP 2016.02.03](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-02-03-edition/)), also based on Wikipedia and [since updated](https://pantheon.world/data/faq).

__Budget apportionments.__ Congress, through a process called appropriations, chooses how much money goes to each US federal agency and program. But the [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/), through a process called apportionment, ultimately [sets the rules for spending those funds](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/s120.pdf), “typically limiting the obligations [an agency] may incur for specified time periods, programs, activities, projects, objects, or any combination thereof.” Those [binding decisions](https://twitter.com/cerin/status/1387815656717012992) have [generally not been available to the public](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3537156-federal-government-getting-ready-to-open-its-books-and-show-us-the-receipts/) — [until last week](https://budget.house.gov/news/press-releases/chairs-yarmuth-and-delauro-achieve-historic-progress-transparency-executive), when OMB launched a [database of apportionments for FY 2022](https://apportionment-public.max.gov/), per a requirement in Congress’s 2022 spending bill.

__Digital trade provisions.__ [Mira Burri et al.](https://digitaltradelaw.ch/taped/)’s [TAPED dataset](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-law/professorships/burri-mira/research/taped/), which “seeks to comprehensively trace developments in the area of digital trade governance,” categorizes 100+ relevant aspects of 300+ [preferential trade agreements](https://mediawiki.middlebury.edu/IPE/Preferential_Trade_Agreement) signed since 2000. The dataset indicates, for instance, that the [Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement](https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/in-force/pafta/Pages/peru-australia-fta) contains binding agreements on personal data protection, nonbinding language on cybersecurity, and no provisions regarding net neutrality.


__The World Cup.__ [Josh Fjelstul](http://www.joshuafjelstul.com/)’s [World Cup Database](https://github.com/jfjelstul/worldcup), [published this month](https://twitter.com/joshfjelstul/status/1546471056642375680), provides “extensively cleaned and cross-validated” information about each of the 21 FIFA World Cup tournaments played so far. Its 27 tables contain “approximately 1.1 million data points” regarding the teams that participated, their players and managers, the referees, match outcomes, goals, penalties, and more.
