*üëã [DIP+ members](https://www.data-is-plural.com/plus/) got a sneak peek of this edition‚Äôs datasets on Monday, plus pointers to a few extra. You can support the newsletter and your career by [becoming a member](https://www.data-is-plural.com/plus/).*


__Public procurement.__ The [Global Public Procurement Dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340924003810) provides standardized data on 72 million government contracts in 42 countries. The dataset, constructed from official sources by the Budapest-based [Government Transparency Institute](https://www.govtransparency.eu/), represents $17 trillion in total procurement. It begins in the 2000s for most of the countries and concludes in 2021. For each contract, it provides information about the tender (title, procedure type, product code, publication date, award date, final price, currency, etc.), government buyer, bidders‚Äô names and locations, and more. The downloadable files are split into [two](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/fwzpywbhgw/3) [repositories](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/w9mzf4vswh/3). The US, Italy, Brazil, Poland, and Colombia have the most contracts represented. __Previously__: The [Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/)‚Äôs [data registry](https://data.open-contracting.org/en/) ([DIP 2023.03.08](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-03-08-edition/)) and [data standard](https://www.open-contracting.org/data-standard/) ([DIP 2020.02.26](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-02-26-edition/)).


__Chain locations and more.__ [All The Places](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/) is ‚Äúa growing set of web scrapers designed to output consistent geodata about as many places of business in the world as possible.‚Äù During its latest weekly run, the project‚Äôs 2,400+ [open-source scrapers](https://github.com/alltheplaces/alltheplaces) collected data on nearly 5 million locations. They include postal collection boxes, ATMs, various fast food chains and chain stores, gas stations, and more. The results are available [on an interactive map](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/map/), [to download in bulk](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/builds), and [by location type](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/spiders). __Related__: Journalist [Matt Stiles](https://mattstiles.me/) maintains a [collection of US-focused scrapers gathering the locations of dozens of chain stores and restaurants](https://github.com/stiles/locations/), with Python notebooks for each scraper.

__Wholesale electricity markets.__ The US Energy Information Administration [recently launched](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61804) a [Wholesale Electricity Market Portal](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/wholesalemarkets/index.php), providing visualizations and [downloads](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/wholesalemarkets/data.php) of market data from [regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_transmission_organization_\(North_America\)) ‚Äî the country‚Äôs electric-grid coordinating entities. The data include ‚Äúday-ahead‚Äù electricity prices, real-time prices, actual/forecasted load and demand, fuel mix by time, and local temperatures. __Learn more__: [A 30-minute introductory video from the EIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8YH-338fXU).


__Food-system indicators.__ The [Food Systems Countdown Initiative](https://www.foodcountdown.org/) produces ‚Äúannual publications to measure, assess, and track the performance of global food systems toward 2030 and the conclusion of the Sustainable Development Goals.‚Äù As part of that work, its [Food Systems Dashboard](https://www.foodsystemsdashboard.org/) incorporates [275 metrics from dozens of sources](https://www.foodsystemsdashboard.org/information/data-sources-and-methodology) about countries‚Äô food availability, affordability, supply chains, safety, and related topics. Examples include [protein supply per capita](https://www.foodsystemsdashboard.org/indicators/food-environments/food-availability/average-protein-supply-3-year-average/map), [number of supermarkets per capita](https://www.foodsystemsdashboard.org/indicators/food-environments/vendor-properties/supermarkets-per-100000-population/map), [trans fat regulations](https://www.foodsystemsdashboard.org/indicators/food-supply-chains/processing-and-packaging/mandatory-removal-of-trans-fats-in-food-products/map), and [food safety poll results](https://www.foodsystemsdashboard.org/indicators/food-environments/food-safety/percent-who-believe-the-government-does-a-good-job-ensuring-food-safety/map).

__Three-dimensional natural history.__ At [MorphoSource](https://www.morphosource.org/), you can ‚Äúfind, view, and download 3D data representing the world‚Äôs natural history, cultural heritage, and scientific collections.‚Äù The service hosts [82,000+ 3D models](https://www.morphosource.org/catalog/media?f%5Bhuman_readable_media_type_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Mesh&locale=en) you can view online; [roughly half](https://www.morphosource.org/catalog/media?f%5Bhuman_readable_media_type_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Mesh&f.publication_status=Open+Download&locale=en) can be downloaded without prior approval. As described in a [recent *BioScience* article](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/3/169/7615104), the [Florida Museum of Natural History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Museum_of_Natural_History)‚Äôs [openVertebrate](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/overt/) project [used MorphoSource](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/science/scientists-ct-scanned-thousands-of-natural-history-specimens-which-you-can-access-for-free/) to share [3D models and volumetric CT scans of 10,000+ amphibian, reptile, fish, bird, and mammal specimens](https://www.morphosource.org/projects/000368762).
