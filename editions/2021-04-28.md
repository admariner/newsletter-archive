Data Is Plural — 2021.04.28 edition
===================================

*Water access points, foreign labor requests, congressional scandals, global mail, and the Tour de France.*


__Water access points.__ Launched [in 2015](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/water-point-data-exchange-launched), the [Water Point Data Exchange](https://www.waterpointdata.org/) today describes [577,000+ specific water access points](https://www.waterpointdata.org/access-data/): boreholes, hand-dug wells, protected springs, rainwater harvest tanks, and more. The platform gathers information from governments and their partners in 50+ countries — mostly in Africa, but also with 10,000+ data-points each in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Haiti, and India. The records indicate the coordinates of each access point, the date checked, water availability when checked, the water source and/or transport system, and other details.

__Foreign labor requests.__ In order to hire foreign workers through the government’s [H-1B, H-2A, and H-2B programs](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs), US employers need permission from the Department of Labor. The agency collects and publishes [data on each “certification” request](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance), detailing the employer (name, location, industry, etc.), job position (title, pay, etc.), and approval status. The datasets go back more than a decade for each program and receive quarterly updates, the most recent being posted last week. __Related__: At BuzzFeed News, we used the data throughout our 2015/16 [series](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jessicagarrison/the-new-american-slavery-invited-to-the-us-foreign-workers-f) [investigating](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jessicagarrison/all-you-americans-are-fired) [the](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kenbensinger/the-coyote) [H-2 program](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kenbensinger/the-pushovers), and maintain a [dataset that standardizes key fields from the raw files](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/H-2-certification-data/).

__Congressional scandals.__ In 2018, [Michael G. Miller](https://www.michaelgmiller.com/) and [Brian T. Hamel](https://www.brianhamel.me/) published [a study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912918781044) examining how voters and donors responded to scandals embroiling members of the US House between 1980 and 2010, [building on](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=4575902&version=1.0) [the work of](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912912451144) [Scott Basinger and others](https://www.bloomsburycollections.com/book/scandal-an-interdisciplinary-approach-to-the-consequences-outcomes-and-significance-of-political-scandals/preface). They have since expanded [the dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/BID3QM), which now covers both the House and the Senate and extends through 2018, providing information on 316 legislator-scandal combinations (categorized as financial, sexual, political, or “other”) and their outcomes.


__Global mail.__ For more than a century, the [Universal Postal Union](https://www.upu.int/en/Home) has collected and published statistics about the world’s postal systems. Online, you can [query and export](https://www.upu.int/en/Universal-Postal-Union/Activities/Research-Publications/Postal-Statistics) country-level data — the number of letter-boxes and permanent post offices, operating revenue, total staff, and much more — going back to 1980. __Related__: [Jon C. Rogowski et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12594) have used historical UPU reports to count the [number of post offices per country between 1875 and 2007](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/33K3EF). __Previously__: [US post office locations, 1639–2000](https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/) ([DIP 2021.04.07](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-04-07-edition/)).


__Le Tour.__ On its official website, the Tour de France lists [riders’ results in its famed bicycle race since 1903](https://www.letour.fr/en/history). The site doesn’t provide downloads, but applied mathematician [Thomas Camminady](https://www.camminady.org/) has [scraped it to build a CSV file](https://github.com/camminady/LeTourDataSet) containing each finisher’s rank, time, team, and more.
