Data Is Plural — 2017.08.02 edition
===================================

*The search for MH370, EU lobbyists, test scores, individual library checkouts, and philharmonic subscribers.*


__Data from the search for MH370.__ After Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared in March 2014, the Australian government undertook an enormous seafloor-mapping operation in search of the lost Boeing 777. Last month, it [released data from the first phase of the project](http://marine.projects.ga.gov.au/mh370-phase-one-data-release.html), which collected 278,000 square kilometers of bathymetry (i.e., seafloor topography) measurements. “In general, the world's deep oceans have had little investigation,” the government explains in [an interactive map](https://geoscience-au.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=038a72439bfa4d28b3dde81cc6ff3214). “Only 10 to 15 percent of the ocean has been mapped with the sonar technology similar to that used in the search for MH370.” As a result, the MH370 search area “is now among the most thoroughly mapped regions of the deep ocean on the planet.” [h/t [Soh Kam Yung](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14802105)]


__European Union lobbying.__ The EU publishes a searchable database of [people and organizations registered to lobby](http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/homePage.do?redir=false&locale=en) the European Parliament and the European Commission. The website [LobbyFacts.eu](https://lobbyfacts.eu/) takes that data and makes it [available via an API](http://api.lobbyfacts.eu/docs/api). LobbyFacts also scrapes the European Commission’s disclosed lobbying meetings, which you [can download here](https://lobbyfacts.eu/transparency_meetings) (warning: 10-megabyte direct download). __Related:__ You can also explore the lobbyists and meetings via [InegrityWatch.eu](http://www.integritywatch.eu/), which uses LobbyFacts’ data. __Previously:__ [U.S. government lobbyists](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-05-31-edition) (DIP 2017.05.31).

__SAT, ACT, and AP scores.__ The California Department of Education publishes [aggregate scores on these high-school tests](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sp/ai/) for each county, district, and school going back to the late 1990s. One hitch: For more than two months, the 2016 AP data “contained 350,000 more tests than had actually been taken,” [according to inewsource.org’s Megan Wood](http://inewsource.org/2017/06/13/state-admits-posting-faulty-data/), who spotted the discrepancies (and others) and got the department to fix them. Similar datasets are available from other states, including [Texas](http://tea.texas.gov/acctres/sat_act_index.html), [Florida](http://www.fldoe.org/accountability/accountability-reporting/act-sat-ap-data/index.stml), and [Pennsylvania](http://www.education.pa.gov/K-12/Assessment%20and%20Accountability/Pages/SAT-and-ACT.aspx#tab-1). __Bonus:__ inewsource.org’s has also published easy-to-search tables of the California [AP](http://data.inewsource.org/interactives/california-ap-scores-2011-2016/), [SAT](http://data.inewsource.org/interactives/california-sat-scores-2011-2016/), and [ACT](http://data.inewsource.org/interactives/california-act-scores-2011-2016/) scores.


__Individual library checkouts.__ The Seattle Public Library publishes a dataset of [every checkout of every physical item](https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/Checkouts-by-Title-Physical-Items-/3h5r-qv5w) (e.g., paperback books and DVDs, but not e-books) since April 2005. It currently contains more than 90 million rows. __Previously:__ [The library’s monthly checkout counts, by title](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-03-01-edition) (DIP 2017.03.01).

__Harmony lovers.__ The New York Philharmonic has published [three spreadsheets listing its subscribers](http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/open-data) — including where they sat, how much they paid, and where they had their tickets sent — for a slew of orchestral seasons between 1883 and the late 1990s. The earliest data includes names, too. (“Miss A. Brown” of 715 Fifth Avenue seems to have been a big fan, having subscribed to 26 seats for the 1890-91 season.) __Previously:__ [The Philharmonic’s performance history](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-10-12-edition) (DIP 2016.10.12).
