Data Is Plural — 2016.02.03 edition
===================================

*Angry travelers, Wikipedia biographies, Zika data, post-Fukushima radiation, and movie chatter.*


__Angry travelers.__ The Transportation Security Administration publishes [spreadsheets of legal claims against the agency](http://www.dhs.gov/tsa-claims-data), including the location, circumstances, and outcome of each claim. The most expensive settlement on record appears to involve a vehicle-related personal injury in July 2004, for which the TSA paid $125,000. On the other end of the spectrum: In 2014, a traveler recouped $1.25 for lost food or drink at Hilton Head Island Airport.

__Famous people on Wikipedia.__ Last month, a group of researchers introduced [Pantheon 1.0](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201575), “a manually verified dataset of globally famous biographies.” It starts with 11,341 Wikipedia biography pages in 25 languages, and adds birthplace, birthdate, gender, occupations, and page views. You can [download the data](http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/about/datasets) or [explore it online](http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/rankings/cities/all/all/-4000/2010/H15). __Baffling factoid:__ As of May 2013, *High School Musical* star [Corbin Bleu had biographies in more language editions](http://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/why-the-hell-is-corbin-bleu-such-a-huge-deal-on-wikipedia) than anyone other than Jesus Christ and Barack Obama. __Related:__ A broader-but-shallower [dataset of more than 400,000 influential people](https://github.com/bdilday/wikipedia_people) on the English-language Wikipedia.

__Zika data.__ Fears about the Zika virus — and a possible, [but not proven](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/zikas-not-a-global-health-emergency-its-potential-consequences-are/), connection to microcephaly — are growing. Little data on the latest outbreak has been published, but here’s an [open guide to what’s available so far](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/zika-data), including reported cases of microcephaly in Brazil and the number of suspected Zika samples sent to Colombia’s national institute of health.


__Post-Fukushima radiation.__ Next month marks the five-year anniversary of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster, the [worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl](http://www.nei.org/News-Media/News/News-Archives/fukushima-chernobyl-and-the-nuclear-event-scale). Since shortly after the meltdown, [volunteers for Safecast](http://blog.safecast.org/history/) have been collecting [radiation measurements in Japan and beyond](http://safecast.org/tilemap/?y=35.2&x=137.9&z=5). The results are [available to download](http://blog.safecast.org/data/) or to [access via API](https://api.safecast.org/en-US/home).


__Movie chatter.__ The [Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) contains 220,579 “conversational exchanges” between 9,035 characters in 617 movies. Included: “Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.”
