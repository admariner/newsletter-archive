Data Is Plural ‚Äî 2022.08.31 edition
===================================

*Billion-dollar disasters, business formations, attempted repairs, Luftwaffe locations, and a fern tree of life.*

*üëã A reader recently asked what criteria I use to evaluate datasets for DIP. I‚Äôve received similar questions in the past, so I decided to write an FAQ-style public response, which you can [find here](https://www.data-is-plural.com/faq/criteria/). It‚Äôs a rough draft; feedback very much welcome.*


__Billion-dollar disasters.__ As ‚Äúthe Nation‚Äôs Scorekeeper in terms of addressing severe weather and climate events in their historical perspective,‚Äù the US [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) maintains an [inventory of the most costly such disasters in the US](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/) ‚Äî¬†those that have caused at least $1 billion in estimated direct losses. The quarterly-updated dataset contains more than 330 severe storms, floods, droughts, wildfires, freezes, and other extreme events since 1980. You can [download, filter, and sort the list](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events) (by disaster type, start/end dates, inflation-adjusted cost, and total deaths), as well as [map](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/mapping), [chart](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/time-series), and [summarize](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/summary-stats) it. [h/t [Gary Price](https://www.infodocket.com/2022/07/27/research-resources-noaa-releases-a-comprehensive-update-to-billion-dollar-disasters-mapping-tool/)]


__Business formations.__ To compile its [Business Formation Statistics](https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html), the US Census Bureau [analyzes several sources](https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/methodology.html), including every application to the IRS for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) and those applicants‚Äô first payroll tax filings. This allows the Bureau to provide monthly counts of business applications and formations by [business type](https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/about_the_data.html), industrial sector, and state. They also publish weekly datasets of application counts by state and an annual dataset that drills down to individual counties; both, however, lack business formation counts and other details [found only in the monthly files](https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/about_the_data.html).

__Attempted repairs.__ The [Open Repair Alliance](https://openrepair.org/), ‚Äúan international group of organisations committed to working towards a world where electrical and electronic products are more durable and easier to repair,‚Äù is developing [an open standard for sharing data about those repairs](https://openrepair.org/open-data/open-standard/). So far, they‚Äôve [gathered 62,000+ records from five partners](https://openrepair.org/open-data/downloads/). Each entry represents a repair session: its date and country, the product‚Äôs brand and [category](https://standard.openrepair.org/standard.html#product-category-values), the repair status, a description of the problem, barriers to repair, and more.


__Luftwaffe locations.__ Data scientist [Sam Weiss](https://scweiss.blogspot.com/) has constructed a [dataset tracking the World War II movements of the Luftwaffe](https://github.com/samcarlos/luftwaffe_locations), Nazi Germany‚Äôs air force. The information, scraped and geocoded from the Luftwaffe-history website [ww2.dk](https://ww2.dk/), includes monthly locations and aggregate statistics (total size, additions, losses) by aircraft type and unit. __Read more__: A [blog post](https://scweiss.blogspot.com/2022/02/a-high-altitude-overview-of-european.html) and [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/boaty__mc/status/1562218213093412864) from Weiss.


__Fern phylogenetics.__ [Joel H. Nitta et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.31.486640v3.full)‚Äôs [Fern Tree of Life](https://fernphy.github.io/) uses ‚Äúa mostly automated, reproducible, open pipeline‚Äù to convert fern DNA sequences from the National Institutes of Health‚Äôs [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) into an [interactive](https://fernphy.github.io/viewer.html), [browsable](https://fernphy.shinyapps.io/ftol_explorer/), and [downloadable](https://fernphy.github.io/downloads.html) evolutionary tree. It currently covers 5,500+ species, from *[Abacopteris aspera](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/1405236-Abacopteris-aspera)* to *[Zealandia vieillardii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealandia_vieillardii)*.
