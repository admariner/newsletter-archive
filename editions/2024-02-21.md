*Self-driving stats, US wetlands, SF overdose deaths, Spain‚Äôs political primaries, and Scott‚Äôs SMS spam.*

*üì¨ Reader [Aleksandra Chirkina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chirkina/) has [explored the relationship](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coffee-veritas-aleksandra-chirkina-6ldoe/) between self-claimed expertise and coffee preferences in [the data](https://bit.ly/gacttCSV+) from [James Hoffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hoffmann)‚Äôs [Great American Coffee Taste Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMOOQfeloH0) (featured in [DIP 2023.11.15](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-11-15-edition/)).

*üëã [DIP+ members](https://www.data-is-plural.com/plus/) got a sneak peek of this week‚Äôs datasets on Monday, links to additional datasets too niche for the newsletter, and a mini-analysis of Hobbes‚Äô appearances in the [Visual Language Research Corpus](https://www.visuallanguagelab.com/vlrc). We also chatted about data-intensive programs that run entirely browser-side and changes to Census surveys‚Äô questions about gender. Come join us!

__Self-driving stats.__ Companies wanting to test or deploy self-driving cars on California‚Äôs public roads must receive a permit from the state DMV‚Äôs [Autonomous Vehicles Program](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/). As part of the requirements, these companies must ‚Äúsubmit annual reports to share how often their vehicles disengaged from autonomous mode during tests (whether because of technology failure or situations requiring the test driver/operator to take manual control of the vehicle to operate safely).‚Äù These [disengagement reports](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/disengagement-reports/) indicate each vehicle‚Äôs company, permit number, [VIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number), monthly miles driven, and annual disengagements ‚Äî including vehicles with none. And for each disengagement, the reports list the vehicle, date, disengagement initiator (vehicle, test driver, remote operator, or passenger), type of location, and a brief summary.

__US wetlands.__ The [National Wetlands Inventory](https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wetlands-inventory), maintained by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, provides [interactive maps](https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wetlands-inventory/wetlands-mapper) and [bulk data](https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wetlands-inventory/wetlands-data) containing ‚Äúgeospatially referenced information on the status, extent, characteristics and functions of wetland, riparian, deepwater, and related aquatic habitats.‚Äù With [contributions from 160+ organizations](https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wetlands-inventory/wetlands-mapping), coordinated through a [dedicated national standard](https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wetlands-inventory/data-standards), the inventory represents ‚Äúmore than 35 million wetland and deepwater features,‚Äù and continues to receive updates. __As seen in__: DIP reader [Simon Greenhill](https://simondgreenhill.github.io/) and coauthors‚Äô [paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi3794), [dataset](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.z34tmpgm7), [explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jkhz5gVUo2w), and [map](https://simondgreenhill.github.io/wotus-map/) using machine learning to predict wetland and river protections under the Clean Water Act.


__SF overdose deaths.__ Last year, 813 people died from accidental drug overdoses in San Francisco, [according to the latest figures from the city‚Äôs Office of the Chief Medical Examiner](https://www.sf.gov/resource/2020/ocme-accidental-overdose-reports). That‚Äôs the highest annual total on record, per the San Francisco Chronicle‚Äôs [overdose data tracker](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/san-francisco-drug-overdose-deaths/), which [combines data](https://github.com/sfchronicle/sf-od-tracker-data) from the medical examiner‚Äôs reports with information from other city agencies, such as [overdose reversals by EMS responders administering naloxone](https://www.sf.gov/data/reducing-fatal-and-non-fatal-overdoses-tenderloin) and [calls handled by the Street Overdose Response Team](https://www.sf.gov/street-overdose-response-team). __As seen in__: [The Chronicle data team‚Äôs latest newsletter](https://link.sfchronicle.com/view/6418a59d2d2faafd080b5ee9kf7kn.2e/907eff80).


__Spain‚Äôs political primaries.__ [Oscar Barber√† et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340924000842) have compiled a [dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/10066112) of the outcomes of 361 primary contests in Spain since 1991, ‚Äúbased on information provided by political parties at the time of the event through their websites, press releases, and journalistic reports.‚Äù It includes primaries to determine candidates for regional, national, and EU elections, as well as for party leadership. For each contest, it lists the party, territory, year, type of post, number of competitors, turnout, incumbent‚Äôs outcome, winner‚Äôs percentage, and more.


__Scott‚Äôs SMS spam.__ In late September 2022, [Scott Lee Chua](https://scottleechua.com/) began preserving every SMS he received, motivated by the recent passage of the Philippine [SIM Registration Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_Registration_Act). By early February 2024, he‚Äôd amassed 3,324 messages, which he has [grouped into five categories and charted](https://spamofthetimes.com/): spam (13% of all messages), one-time passwords (12%), marketing (10%), government notices (1%), and ‚Äúmessages I both expect and welcome‚Äù (63%). He‚Äôs also [published a partially-redacted dataset](https://github.com/scottleechua/data/tree/main/spam-and-marketing-sms) of each message‚Äôs time received, time read, sender, text, and category.
