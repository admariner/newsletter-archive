Data Is Plural — 2017.02.22 edition
===================================

*Subsidized housing, nearby stars, UV exposure, NBA refereeing, and the Ace of Spades.*


__Subsidized housing.__ [Earlier this month](https://twitter.com/HUDUSERnews/status/830145945987858436), the Department of Housing and Urban Development released its “[Picture of Subsidized Households](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/assthsg.html)” report for 2016. The dataset describes the living conditions, demographics, and finances of families receiving subsidies via the agency’s various programs — including public housing, Section 8 vouchers, and several others. The figures are provided for the entire U.S., by state, metro area, housing agency, city, county, Census tract, and even by housing development. HUD provides a [data dictionary](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/pictures/dictionary_2016.pdf) explaining each field, as well as a tool to query the data without downloading the entire dataset.

__Nearby stars and potential exoplanets.__ Last week, a team of researchers [released a dataset](http://home.dtm.ciw.edu/ebps/data/) containing “60,949 Doppler velocity measurements covering 1,624 stars taken over 20 years” from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The authors have already [used the dataset to identify more than 100 exoplanets](http://news.mit.edu/2017/dataset-nearby-stars-available-public-exoplanets-0213) — i.e., planets outside our solar system. Now, they’re hoping that the public and other researchers will use their data to help discover even more. __Previously:__ [The NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-05-11-edition) (May 11, 2016).

__Local UV exposure.__ The National Cancer Institute has estimated [ultraviolet radiation exposure estimates for every county](https://gis.cancer.gov/tools/uv-exposure/) in the continental United States. The estimates, based on a [peer-reviewed methodology](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zaria_Tatalovich/publication/228942287_A_comparison_of_thiessen-polygon_kriging_and_spline_models_of_UV_exposure/links/56605c3b08aebae678aa0abf.pdf) and [30 years of data from the National Solar Radiation Data Base](http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/), can also be explored using [the institute’s mapping tool](https://gis.cancer.gov/geoviewer/app/). Luna County, New Mexico had the highest estimated UV exposure at 5,723 Watt-hours per square meter; Clallam County, Washington, was exposed to the least estimated UV radiation, at 3,012 Wh/m².

__NBA refereeing.__ Since March 2015, the National Basketball Association has issued post-game reports reviewing referees’ calls during the final two minutes of neck-and-neck games. The NBA [publishes those reports as PDFs](http://official.nba.com/nba-last-two-minute-reports-archive/); journalist Russell Goldenberg has been [converting them to spreadsheet-friendly CSVs](https://github.com/polygraph-cool/last-two-minute-report/tree/master/output). Goldenberg is also [analyzing and visualizing the data](https://pudding.cool/2017/02/two-minute-report/) — updated daily — to show, for example, which players are benefitting most from incorrect and missed calls. (Answer so far: the Wizards’ Marcin Gortat and the Nets’ Brook Lopez.)


__Pick a card, any card.__ When researchers [asked 1,354 people](http://www.psychologyofmagic.org/research/cards/paper.html) to name or visualize a playing card, 1 in 6 of them first chose the Ace of Spades. [Here’s the data](https://osf.io/534g2/), which includes each participant’s three card choices, age, and gender.
