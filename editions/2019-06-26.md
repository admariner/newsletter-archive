Data Is Plural — 2019.06.26 edition
===================================

*Space imagery, the Supreme Court versus Congress, art-world salaries, UK post-graduation earnings, and “state of the state” speeches.*


__Space imagery.__ You can browse [NASA’s Image and Video Library](https://images.nasa.gov/) online; you can also access it [via NASA’s API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#Images). Through that interface, you can search by caption, keyword, location, photographer, year created, and other fields; in return, you get structured data on each media file. The library was [launched two years ago](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-unveils-new-searchable-video-audio-and-imagery-library-for-the-public), bringing together more than 140,000 images, videos, and audio files that had previously been spread across dozens of separate collections.

__Supreme Court v. Congress.__ [The Judicial Review of Congress dataset](https://scholar.princeton.edu/kewhitt/judicial-review-congress-database), compiled by Princeton politics professor [Keith E. Whittington](https://scholar.princeton.edu/kewhitt), “catalogs all the cases in which the U.S. Supreme Court has substantively reviewed the constitutionality of a provision or application of a federal law.” The dataset currently covers 1,308 cases, stretching from the high court’s founding through its 2017 term. For each case, it specifies the statute being reviewed, how long the statute had been in effect, the main constitutional issues at hand, the outcome, and more.

__Art-world salaries.__ [This is the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14_cn3afoas7NhKvHWaFKqQGkaZS5rvL6DFxzGqXQa6o/edit#gid=0) that “[broke the art world’s culture of silence](https://frieze.com/article/how-google-spreadsheet-broke-art-worlds-culture-silence).” In just a few weeks, [Michelle Millar Fisher](https://twitter.com/michellemfisher) and [anonymous colleagues](https://twitter.com/AMTransparency) have collected more than 2,600 self-reported salaries from their fellow curators, managers, interns, and other art-world employees. __Related:__ “It took us three minutes to build this spreadsheet,” [the organizers have written in The Art Newspaper](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/comment/missions-statements-and-paychecks-let-s-put-our-money-where-our-mouths-are). “It is not a perfect survey tool, nor was it ever intended to be. While we’ll work with statistics professionals to review and glean meaningful facts [...] Its primary goal is to catalyse us all into action.” [h/t [u/cavedave](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/by95n7/how_a_google_spreadsheet_broke_the_art_worlds/)]


__UK post-graduation earnings.__ The United Kingdom’s Department of Education publishes data on its [university graduates’ annual earnings](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-higher-education-graduate-employment-and-earnings) 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after graduation, broken down by school attended, subject studied, and demographic characteristics.

__The State Of The State Of The States.__ FiveThirtyEight has collected [the text of all 50 state governors’ 2019 annual addresses](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/state-of-the-state), and has [analyzed the most common words and phrases](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americas-governors-are-talking-about/) used by Republican and Democratic governors.
