*üëã Surprise! Say hello to [Data Is Plural: The Podcast](https://podcast.data-is-plural.com/). The first season is [now available in its entirety](https://podcast.data-is-plural.com/) ‚Äî five concise episodes, each based on data previously featured in this newsletter. This is my first time creating a podcast, and I still have lots to learn. So please do let me know what you think; critiques and suggestions for improvement particularly appreciated. And a __big, hearty thanks__ to this season‚Äôs guests ([Andy](https://www.buygiantpumpkins.com/), [Mattie](https://mattieburkert.com/), [Pablo](https://twitter.com/pmedranoviz), [Irena](https://irenatfh.github.io/), [Vikram](https://twitter.com/voberoi)), who generously agreed to be interviewed for a podcast that, at the time, was just a vague idea.*


__Local public meetings.__ [LocalView](https://localview.net/), developed by [Soubhik Barari](https://soubhikbarari.com/) and [Tyler Simko](https://tylersimko.com/), ‚Äúis the largest dataset of local government public meetings ‚Äî the central policy-making process in American local government ‚Äî as they are captured on video.‚Äù In a [recent paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02044-y), the authors describe how they built the [dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/NJTBEM), which is based on 130,000+ YouTube-hosted videos of such meetings in 1,000+ US cities and counties, covering the years 2006 to 2022. The dataset lists each meeting‚Äôs date, jurisdiction, and government body (e.g., municipal council, school board, etc.), plus the video‚Äôs ID, title, channel, transcript, and more.

__Health workers.__ The World Health Organization‚Äôs [Global Health Workforce Statistics database](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/health-workforce) presents annual, national estimates of the number of medical doctors, nursing and midwifery professionals, community health workers, and several other types of health personnel. The estimates come from the WHO‚Äôs [National Health Workforce Accounts system](https://www.who.int/activities/improving-health-workforce-data-and-evidence), national censuses, labor force surveys, and other sources. For medical doctors, the estimates span nearly 200 countries, with the majority having estimates as recent as 2020 or 2021. Twenty countries‚Äô estimates go back to the 1960s (and, for Spain, all the way back to 1952).

__Kremlin posts.__ [Giorgio Comai](https://giorgiocomai.eu/)‚Äôs ‚Äú[text as data & data in the text](https://tadadit.xyz/about/about.html)‚Äù [project](https://tadadit.xyz/) ‚Äúaims at facilitating structured analysis of on-line contents related to conflicts in the post-Soviet space by providing easier access to relevant datasets and tools.‚Äù [Those datasets](https://tadadit.xyz/datasets/) include the URL, title, text, date, and other metadata of [all posts published on the Kremlin‚Äôs English-language website](https://tadadit.xyz/datasets/kremlin.ru_en/) since the year 2000; [on the Kremlin‚Äôs Russian-language website](https://tadadit.xyz/datasets/kremlin.ru_ru/); [and by *Zavtra* since late 1996](https://tadadit.xyz/datasets/zavtra.ru_ru/). __Previously__: [Foreign ministry statements](https://focusdataproject.com/) ([DIP 2022.03.09](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-03-09-edition/)).

__Carbon capture projects.__ The [National Energy Technology Laboratory](https://netl.doe.gov/about/mission-overview) maintains a [map and dataset](https://netl.doe.gov/carbon-management/carbon-storage/worldwide-ccs-database) of [carbon capture and storage](https://netl.doe.gov/carbon-management/carbon-storage/faqs/carbon-storage-faqs) projects ‚Äúactive, proposed, and terminated‚Äù in 30+ countries since the 1970s. The latest version of the dataset includes 400+ entries, slightly more than are on the map. It lists each project‚Äôs name, company, location, date, type, scope, magnitude, status, technology, cost, summary, and other details. __As seen in__: ‚Äú[What is carbon capture and storage? Where is it happening in the US?](https://usafacts.org/articles/what-is-carbon-capture-and-storage-where-is-it-happening-in-the-us/)‚Äù (USAFacts).


__Milan drinking fountains.__ Milan‚Äôs government publishes a [dataset of 600+ local vedovelle](https://dati.comune.milano.it/it/dataset/ds502_fontanelle-nel-comune-di-milano), the [distinctive](https://memorialdrinkingfountains.wordpress.com/2019/03/30/vedovelle-fountains/) (green, cast iron, dragon-headed) drinking fountains that dot the city. The dataset provides each fountain‚Äôs coordinates, [municipal zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalities_of_Milan), and neighborhood. __As seen in__: ‚Äú[Tutto sulle fontanelle di Milano](https://www.ilpost.it/2022/06/27/fontanelle-vedovelle-milano/),‚Äù with a map of the locations, by Il Post‚Äôs [Isaia Invernizzi](https://twitter.com/easyinve).
