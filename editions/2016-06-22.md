Data Is Plural — 2016.06.22 edition
===================================

*Nonprofits, 6,000 years of urbanization, bull vs. man, new homes, and the Hum.*


__Nonprofit IRS filings — at long last.__ Last week, the Internal Revenue Service [released](https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-makes-electronically-filed-form-990-data-available-in-new-format) a [huge dataset of nonprofits’ annual Form 990 filings](https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/irs-990/), which provide details on program expenses, salaries, and more. More than 60% of Form 990s are filed digitally, according to the IRS. Previously, those forms were only available as images; now the IRS is publishing them as analysis-friendly XML files. (You can also [download the data in bulk from the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/IRS990-efile), thanks to Carl Malamud, the public domain advocate who led the fight for 990s-as-XML.) One early observer [noted](https://twitter.com/licyeus/status/743308612672466944) that the some of the data was misformatted, and has provided [instructions for fixing it](https://gist.github.com/licyeus/95b99d6feb423ebea604b5f3e2cdf590).

__6,000 years of urbanization.__ Earlier this month, researchers published “[the first spatially explicit dataset of urban settlements from 3700 BC to AD 2000](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201634),” along with a detailed methodology. The [dataset](http://urban.yale.edu/data) digitizes and geocodes population numbers originally tabulated by historian Tertius Chandler (*[Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth](http://www.worldcat.org/title/four-thousand-years-of-urban-growth/oclc/59678315))* and political scientist George Modelski (*[World Cities: -3,000 to 2,000](http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-cities-3000-to-2000/oclc/57695214)*). Though “far from comprehensive,” the authors say that the dataset a “first step towards understanding the geographic distribution of urban populations throughout history.” __Related:__ “[Watch 6,000 years of urbanization taking over the world](http://qz.com/706051/706051/).”


__Bull vs. man.__ Next month, [thousands](http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/encierro/como-correr/cuanta-gente-corre-en-el-encierro-de-sanfermin) of adrenaline junkies will gather in Pamplona for the city’s annual [Running of the Bulls](http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/encierro/que-es). The San Fermin festival, which organizes the spectacle, publishes [injury data](http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/encierro/buscador/buscador-encierros) on its website. (Here’s [a shortcut to display every year of data](http://www.sanfermin.com/old/encierrometro/buscador_encierros.php?lang=eng&buscar=1), instead of one year at a time.) Last year, the bulls gored 10 runners and injured another 27. __Related:__ “[Your Chances Of Being Gored By A Bull In Pamplona Are Getting Higher](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/your-chances-of-being-gored-by-a-bull-in-pamplona-are-getting-higher/).”


__2BR with vinyl siding, sweet 2BR with vinyl siding.__ The U.S. Census Bureau’s [Annual Characteristics of New Housing](http://www.census.gov/construction/chars/) culls data on features such as square footage, wall material, number of bedrooms, and number of fireplaces. (Air conditioning was present in 93% of new single-family homes built in 2015, up from 49% in 1973.) __Related:__ “[Houses Keep Getting Bigger, Even as Families Get Smaller](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/upshot/houses-keep-getting-bigger-even-as-families-get-smaller.html).” [h/t [Lindsey Cook](http://tinyletter.com/UpDownAllAround/letters/orlando)]


__The Hum.__ “[Most people find this website because they are searching for the source of an unusual low frequency sound](http://www.thehum.info/).” The [World Hum Database](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1EyjVZqUPpoXGQDa_cry9DqFaBVMOgEyq-3qo85bx#rows:id=1) currently includes more than 10,000 reader-submitted reports, including a recent submissions that describe the noise as sounding “like a fridge,” “like a train in the distance,” and “like a cicada that never shuts up.” [h/t [Susie Cambria](https://twitter.com/susiecambria)]
