__African American biographies, 1508–1865.__ The [African American National Biography](https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/AANB), first printed in 2008 and expanded to a [twelve-volume second edition in 2013](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/african-american-national-biography-9780199920778), is “the most extensive African American biographical encyclopedia ever compiled, including the widest range of historically significant black individuals possible.” Edited by [Henry Louis Gates, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Louis_Gates_Jr.) and [Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Brooks_Higginbotham), the print volumes feature nearly 5,000 entries, with additional biographies published in an [online collection](https://oxfordaasc.com/page/about) ([subscription required](https://oxfordaasc.com/page/subscribe#personal-subscriptions)). Executive editor [Steven J. Niven](https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/people/steven-j-niven) has [created](https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue2-african-american-national-biography/) a [dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FIEYGJ) describing the 1,300+ people in the encyclopedia born before the US abolition of slavery. It includes their names, dates and places of birth, occupations, whether they were ever enslaved and/or freed before abolition, how they obtained freedom, and much more.


__Foreign direct investment.__ Among its many activities, the [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/) collects data on [US-owned businesses’ direct investments abroad](https://www.bea.gov/surveys/diasurv) and [those by foreign-owned businesses in the US](https://www.bea.gov/surveys/fdiusurv). The agency provides [statistics based on that data](https://www.bea.gov/itable/direct-investment-multinational-enterprises), aggregated by industry and country. The metrics, available as [spreadsheets](https://www.bea.gov/international/direct-investment-and-multinational-enterprises-comprehensive-data) and [interactive tables](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?ReqID=2&step=1), include cumulative investments, overall transaction flows, foreign affiliates’ employee counts, and more. __As seen in__: “[Why are US companies investing more abroad?](https://usafacts.org/articles/why-are-us-companies-investing-more-abroad/)” (USAFacts).


__India’s high-court judges.__ [Know Your High Court Judges](https://justicehub.in/initiatives/khoj-india), a multi-institution collaboration, has compiled biographical and professional data on all 1,700+ judges appointed to India’s [high courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_courts_of_India) (each state and union territory’s top appellate court) between late 1993 and mid-2021. The details, based on a [range of official sources](https://justicehub.in/dataset/khoj-india/resource/fa59eb2e-04a5-461f-94e3-1367f67c3a8c), include each judge’s name, gender, date and place of birth, dates of appointment and retirement, courts served, prior experience, and more.

__US aquifers.__ [Merhawi GebreEgziabher et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29678-7), seeing several shortcomings of the [US Geological Survey’s aquifer location data](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/principal-aquifers-united-states) for “locally relevant” research, decided to build the [United States Aquifer Database](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/d2260651b51044d0b5cb2d293d21af08/). It delineates the [boundaries](https://ucsb.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/nearby/index.html?appid=2a238e4ed2434d21b3b53c861a064d8f), constructed “after reviewing hundreds of primary literature sources,” of 440 aquifer systems in the contiguous US — from the [Abbotsford-Sumas Aquifer](https://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/plan_protect_sustain/groundwater/aquifers/absumas.html) straddling the Washington-Canada border to the [Biscayne Aquifer](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/caribbean-florida-water-science-center-%28cfwsc%29/science/mapping-water-levels-biscayne) in southern Florida. __Read more__: [A visual tour of twelve aquifers](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a91f061759e64e44af38daf6cefa4259).


__Prognosticating groundhogs.__ [Paul Craig](https://pcraig3.ca/)’s [Groundhog-Day.com](https://groundhog-day.com/) calls [itself](https://groundhog-day.com/about) “the leading data source for North America’s prognosticating groundhogs and their yearly predictions.” Its [structured data](https://groundhog-day.com/api) lists the names, descriptions, locations, and prediction histories for [74 real and “alternative” groundhogs](https://groundhog-day.com/groundhogs), the latter of which include [Lucy the Lobster](https://groundhog-day.com/groundhogs/lucy-the-lobster) and [Dover Doug](https://groundhog-day.com/groundhogs/dover-doug), a human in a groundhog suit.
