Data Is Plural — 2019.08.07 edition
===================================

*Opioids, federal judges, sub-Saharan public health facilities, icebergs, and state liquor prices.*

&nbsp;

**Opioid distribution.** The Washington Post and the Charleston Gazette-Mail recently [won a year-long legal battle](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/how-an-epic-legal-battle-brought-a-secret-drug-database-to-light/2019/08/02/3bc594ce-b3d4-11e9-951e-de024209545d_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.e32623ec4459) to obtain a large slice of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s data on opioid shipments. (The data had previously been provided to plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit, but a judge had sealed the records from public access.) The Post has [begun publishing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/76-billion-opioid-pills-newly-released-federal-data-unmasks-the-epidemic/2019/07/16/5f29fd62-a73e-11e9-86dd-d7f0e60391e9_story.html) [its findings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/), as well as [a cleaned-up version of the dataset](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/07/18/how-download-use-dea-pain-pills-database/) that focuses on “shipments of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills to chain pharmacies, retail pharmacies and practitioners” between 2006 and 2012. The raw, unsealed dataset [is also available](https://twitter.com/dataeditor/status/1151905391678230528). **Related:** [A 500-row subset](https://github.com/r4dat/ARCOS_OPIOIDS_WashPo), so you can see what the data looks like before downloading the large files.

&nbsp;

**Federal judges.** The government-run Federal Judicial Center publishes a daily-updated “biographical directory” of [all judges who’ve served on federal courts](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/biographical-directory-article-iii-federal-judges-export) — the Supreme Court, appellate courts, district courts, the bygone circuit courts, plus a few others. The directory is presented as structured data, and includes information on the judges’ demographics, educations, professional careers, nominations and more. **Related:** The University of South Carolina’s [Judicial Research Initiative](http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/poli/juri/index.htm) also maintains [historical datasets of district and appellate court judges](http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/poli/juri/attributes.htm); they contain many of the same variables plus some extras, such as religion and estimated net worth.

&nbsp;

**Hospitals, from Angola to Zimbabwe.** An international team of researchers [has compiled](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0142-2) a “comprehensive spatial inventory” of [nearly 100,000 public health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa](https://springernature.figshare.com/articles/Public_health_facilities_in_sub_Saharan_Africa/7725374/1). The dataset includes facilities in 50 countries and lists each facility’s name, country, administrative region, type, ownership, and coordinates.

&nbsp;

**Antarctic icebergs.** Brigham Young University’s [Antarctic Iceberg Tracking Database](https://www.scp.byu.edu/data/iceberg/) provides surveillance on hundreds of floating hunks of ice, past and present. The records cover 1978 plus 1992 through mid-2019; a subset of the database lists 117 icebergs’ daily position, estimated size, and rotation angle.

&nbsp;

**State liquor prices.** About a third of US states hold a [monopoly on the local sale of hard liquor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage_control_state). Some of them — including [Virginia](https://www.abc.virginia.gov/products/products-faqs/product-downloads), [Alabama](https://alabcboard.gov/QPL), [Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/lara/0,4601,7-154-89334_10570_14173---,00.html), [Utah](https://webapps2.abc.utah.gov/Production/OnlinePriceList/DisplayDivCategory.aspx), and [North Carolina](https://abc.nc.gov/Pricing/PriceList) — let you download their price lists as spreadsheets.
