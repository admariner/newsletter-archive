Data Is Plural — 2020.01.01 edition
===================================

*Water quality, legislator ideology, Google copyright complaints, California university history, and game show risk-taking.*


*But first ... a small New Year’s gift for DIP readers: [You can now receive the newsletter via RSS](https://github.com/data-is-plural/newsletter-archive/blob/master/README.md).*


__Global water quality.__ The UN’s [GEMStat project](https://gemstat.org) provides “scientifically-sound data” on freshwater quality around the world. The [data portal](https://gemstat.org/data/data-portal/) lets visitors [explore](https://gemstat.bafg.de/applications/public.html?publicuser=PublicUser) and [download](https://gemstat.org/custom-data-request/) water-sample results from thousands of stations in more than 80 countries. The information available for each sample varies, but it can include chemical, biological, and physical properties. __Note__: Not all locations have been sampled recently, and data downloads are limited to 500 stations at a time and for noncommercial purposes only. __Related__: “[The Invisible Water Crisis](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/32245),” a World Bank report from last year that used the GEMStat data.

__State legislator ideologies.__ Political scientists [Boris Shor](https://research.bshor.com) and [Nolan McCarty](https://www.princeton.edu/~nmccarty/)’s have [assigned ideology scores](https://americanlegislatures.com/faq/), on a conservative-to-liberal scale, to every US lawmaker in all 50 state legislatures. The [most recent update](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6QWX7Q), published May 2018, covers more than 22,000 legislators from 1993 through 2016. Shor and McCarty derived the numeric scores from a combination of legislative voting records and responses to Vote Smart’s “[Political Courage Test](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/about/political-courage-test/).”


__Copyright complaints.__ Google has received millions of requests from copyright holders to delist billions of URLs from its search results. The company’s [transparency reports](https://transparencyreport.google.com) include a section where you can [explore and download data](https://transparencyreport.google.com/copyright/overview) about these requests. One of the datasets describes 8.5 million delisting requests, with their dates, copyright holders, numbers of URLs targeted, and links to more details in [the Lumen archive](https://www.lumendatabase.org). Another contains every web domain targeted, while another lists the URLs for which Google says it took no action.

__California university history.__ The [UC ClioMetric History Project](https://uccliometric.org) is digitizing decades of administrative records from the University of California and other schools in the state (such as USC and Stanford). So far, they’ve uploaded data on more than [750,000 student enrollments](https://uccliometric.org/students/), [tens of thousands of faculty members](https://uccliometric.org/faculty/), and [800,000 courses](https://uccliometric.org/courses/).


__Game show gambles.__ To study how people make decisions in risky situations, a team of academics [analyzed contestants’ choices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=636508) in 100+ episodes of [Deal or No Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_or_No_Deal) that aired in the Netherlands, Germany, and the US. Their dataset is available [through ICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/113232/version/V1/view) (registration required) and [the Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/2018*/https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.98.1.38).
