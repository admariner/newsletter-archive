__Prison demographics.__ In a recent paper in *Nature*, [Brennan Klein et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05980-2) describe how they ‚Äúmanually assembled and validated a dataset covering all 50 US states, the District of Columbia and the Federal Bureau of Prisons to both quantify the widening racial disparity observed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncover its plausible causes.‚Äù Their [Dataset on Incarcerated Populations](https://github.com/jkbren/incarcerated-populations-data) provides the monthly number ([or interpolated estimates](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05980-2#MOESM1)) of people, by race/ethnicity, in each prison system. The dataset goes back at least to 2010 for most states; for 18 states, it also includes admission/release counts. __Related__: The Bureau of Justice Statistics‚Äô [annual data on prison demographics](https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/list?series_filter=Prisoners), which provide state-level counts by sex but not race/ethnicity. __Previously__: [The Vera Institute‚Äôs Incarceration Trends Dataset](https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends) ([DIP 2019.01.02](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-01-02-edition/)) and [NYU Public Safety Lab‚Äôs Jail Data Initiative](https://jaildatainitiative.org/) ([DIP 2023.04.12](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-04-12-edition/)).

__More AI incidents.__ The [AI, Algorithmic, and Automation Incidents and Controversies](https://www.aiaaic.org/)  initiative, founded by [Charlie Pownall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charliepownall/) in 2019, [maintains](https://www.aiaaic.org/aiaaic-repository/aiaaic-repository-governance) a [repository](https://www.aiaaic.org/aiaaic-repository/about-the-aiaaic-repository) of such events, as well as related systems (e.g., [GPT-4](https://www.aiaaic.org/aiaaic-repository/ai-and-algorithmic-incidents-and-controversies/gpt-4-large-language-model)) and datasets (e.g., [Labeled Faces in the Wild](https://www.aiaaic.org/aiaaic-repository/ai-and-algorithmic-incidents-and-controversies/labeled-faces-in-the-wild-lfw-dataset)). The [project‚Äôs spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bn55B4xz21-_Rgdr8BBb2lt0n_4rzLGxFADMlVW0PYI/edit) features 1,000+ entries, each listing a title, type, year, country, sector, operator, purpose, and more ‚Äî¬†and linking to more detailed descriptions on AIAAIC‚Äôs website. __Previously__: [The AI Incident Database](https://incidentdatabase.ai/) ([DIP 2023.04.19](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-04-19-edition/)).


__Blocked rail crossings.__ ‚ÄúAs rail profits soar, blocked crossings force kids to crawl under trains to get to school,‚Äù a [recent investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/trains-crossing-blocked-kids-norfolk-southern) by [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/) and [InvestigateTV](https://www.investigatetv.com/) has found. In addition to on-the-ground reporting, photos, and video, the article cites the [Federal Railroad Administration‚Äôs database](https://www.fra.dot.gov/blockedcrossings/incidents) of [blocked crossing complaints](https://www.fra.dot.gov/blockedcrossings/). The database‚Äôs ~70,000 reports, going back to December 2019, each list a [crossing ID](https://railroads.dot.gov/safety-data/crossing-and-inventory-data/crossing-inventory-lookup), street, city, state, railroad, reported incident date, duration, reason, impacts, and additional comments. __Related__: [The FRA‚Äôs database of all rail crossings](https://railroads.dot.gov/crossing-and-inventory-data/grade-crossing-inventory/highwayrail-crossing-database-files).

__Grammatical phenomena.__ [Grambank](https://grambank.clld.org/), the [result](https://www.mpg.de/20186271/0418-evan-grambank-shows-the-diversity-of-the-world-s-languages-150495-x) of a [collaboration](https://grambank.clld.org/contributors) involving 100+ linguists, examines a range of grammatical phenomena, ‚Äúfrom word order to verbal tense, nominal plurals, and many other well-studied comparative linguistic variables.‚Äù The project‚Äôs dataset, available to [download](https://github.com/grambank/grambank) and explore online, spans [195 such features](https://grambank.clld.org/parameters) across [2,400+ languages and dialects](https://grambank.clld.org/languages). For instance, [here‚Äôs the page for feature GB030](https://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB030#2/21.0/152.1), which asks, ‚ÄúIs there a gender distinction in independent 3rd person pronouns?‚Äù [h/t [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/)]


__Planetary nomenclature.__ The [International Astronomical Union](http://www.iau.org/)‚Äôs [Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature](https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/) ‚Äúprovides a unique system of official names for planetary surface features, natural satellites, dwarf planets, and planetary rings for the benefit of the international science community, educators, and the general public.‚Äù You can browse, [search](https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/AdvancedSearch), and  the [download](https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/GIS_Downloads) the data, as well as [view images of their locations](https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/Images). __As seen in__: [Cinzia Bongino](https://www.cinziabongino.com/)‚Äôs [The Names on the Moon](https://www.behance.net/gallery/168652141/The-Names-on-the-Moon).
