Data Is Plural — 2021.12.15 edition
===================================

*Faster-turnaround mortality data, zero-day exploits, reproductive assistance in the EU, country leaders’ birthplaces, and 1 million Bandcamp sales.*


__Faster-turnaround mortality data.__ Last week, the CDC began publishing [provisional US mortality statistics for 2018 to the near-present](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html). The data are [based on death certificates](https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html) and can be queried by location, timing, demographics, and causes of death. They’re similar to the CDC’s [non-provisional statistics for earlier years](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html), but “with a lag of just a few weeks” instead of more than a year, [writes](https://coviddatadispatch.com/2021/12/12/new-cdc-mortality-data-real-time-public-health-surveillance-at-a-highly-granular-level/) the [COVID-19 Data Dispatch](https://coviddatadispatch.com/)’s [Betsy Ladyzhets](https://betsyladyzhets.com/). __Read more__: “[Researchers say the US is undercounting COVID deaths. Now we have a tool to figure out why](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2021/dec/09/the-cdc-just-released-new-data-on-deaths-in-the-us/),” an article by Ladyzhets and other members of [Documenting COVID-19](https://documentingcovid19.io/about), who are [hosting a webinar](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_PxEsCSn9SeqkFn-xQu37DA) about the data today.


__Zero-day exploits.__ Researchers at Google’s [Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/about-project-zero.html) study “[zero-day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing))” vulnerabilities — software flaws discovered by hackers before they can be fixed. Since 2019, the team [has published](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/0day.html) a [spreadsheet of known zero-day exploits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/view#gid=0) “in the wild.” The spreadsheet’s 200 entries go back to 2014 and note the software product, its vendor, the flaw’s type and description, date discovered, date patched, and more. __Previously__: [The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list](https://cve.mitre.org/) ([DIP 2018.12.12](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-12-12-edition/)).

__Reproductive assistance in the EU.__ Reporters at [Civio](https://civio.es/en/about-us/) have collected data on the [access to](https://datos.civio.es/dataset/acceso-a-la-reproduccion-asistida-en-europa/), and [availability of financial aid for](https://datos.civio.es/dataset/reproduccion-asistida-que-costea-la-sanidad-publica-en-europa/), in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination in 43 European countries, noting limits based on age, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors. __Read more__: “[More than half of European countries prohibit access to assisted reproduction for lesbians and almost a third do so for single women](https://civio.es/medicamentalia/2021/11/02/ART-EU-access/).” __Related__: [Civio’s visualization code in Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/collection/@civio/619-art-eu).

__Country leaders’ birthplaces.__ [Axel Dreher et al.](http://www.axel-dreher.de/Spouses.pdf)’s [Political Leaders’ Affiliation Database](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FYUS575) lists the birthplaces and ethnicities of 1,109 leaders of 177 countries between 1989 and 2020. The birthplaces are described at several levels of administrative detail and are ascribed a latitude, longitude, and an indication of those coordinates’ precision. The ethnicities are drawn from external, linked sources. [h/t [Simon Heß](https://twitter.com/simonhhess/status/1448388780294090756)]


__1 million Bandcamp sales.__ [Components](https://components.one/)’ [Andrew Thompson](https://twitter.com/asthompson) has published a [dataset of 1,000,000 sales](https://components.one/datasets/bandcamp-sales) on the music platform [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) during a few weeks in late 2020. For each sale, it includes the item’s description, price, and type; the buyer’s country; a timestamp; and more. It’s a slice of the data used in “[The Chaos Bazaar: An analysis of Bandcamp sales, 9/1/2020 - 12/31/2020](https://components.one/posts/bandcamp-the-chaos-bazaar).”
