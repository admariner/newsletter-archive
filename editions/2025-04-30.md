===================================

*Refugee and asylum policies, tens of millions of flights, US sewer overflow sites, previously unmapped waterways, and canoe marathons.*


__Refugee and asylum policies.__ The [Dataset of World Refugee and Asylum Policies](https://datanalytics.worldbank.org/dwrap/) “offers a complete dataset of de jure asylum and refugee policies” across 190+ countries and 70+ years, from 1951 to 2022. The project, developed by [Christopher W. Blair et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/liberal-displacement-policies-attract-forced-migrants-in-the-global-south/F6872E76FBB27F61B96B90193BDE9A1D) and updated in collaboration with the [Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement](https://www.jointdatacenter.org/), evaluates [54 aspects of each policy across five dimensions](https://datanalytics.worldbank.org/dwrap/_w_3baf84c2101c4832b34da12495c9dbfc/DWRAP_Tech_Guide_Sep2024.pdf): access, services, the ability to earn a livelihood, freedom of movement, and political inclusion. Each aspect is scored on a 0-1-2-3 scale. The results are available to [download](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0066171/Dataset-of-World-Refugee-and-Asylum-Policies--DWRAP-) and to analyze online.

__Tens of millions of flights.__ [Sebastiaan Menger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastiaanmenger/) has developed a [series of quarterly datasets](https://github.com/MrAirspace/aircraft-flight-schedules) “featuring global, high-level flight schedules extracted from worldwide aircraft ADS-B position transmissions,” going back to early 2024. Each quarterly extract, derived from the [ADSB.lol](https://github.com/adsblol) flight-tracking initiative’s [open data](https://www.adsb.lol/docs/overview/introduction/), features 10–13 million flights. Each flight’s entry indicates the aircraft’s registration number, type, call sign, airline (when applicable), approximate liftoff/touchdown times, and origin/destination airports. 


__US sewer overflow sites.__ “There are approximately 700 communities in the United States that have combined sewer systems and experience combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharges,” [according to the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/npdes/where-combined-sewer-overflow-outfalls-are-located), whose [National Combined Sewer Overflow Inventory](https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads/cso-inventory-summary) lists 8,600+ [outfalls](https://www.epa.gov/npdes/combined-sewer-overflows-csos) across those communities. The [downloadable](https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads#downloads) inventory, last updated in September 2023, provides each outfall’s location and relevant information from the [National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System](https://www.epa.gov/npdes)’s [permit database](https://echo.epa.gov/help/loading-tool/monitoring-data-download-help). __As seen in__: “[Minority communities twice as likely to have sewage polluting nearby river or creek, CBS News analysis shows](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sewage-river-creek-us-minority-community/)”. __Previously__: [Sewer overflows in England](https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/21e15f12-0df8-4bfc-b763-45226c16a8ac) ([DIP 2024.05.15](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2024-05-15-edition/)).


__Previously unmapped waterways.__  [WaterNet Global Waterways](https://source.coop/repositories/fika/waternet/description) is “a new global dataset that predicts the locations of waterways around the world” using an AI model [trained on satellite imagery and elevation data](https://medium.com/fika-blog/waternet-ai-powered-global-water-mapping-triples-known-waterways-bc3095783661). A collaboration between [Bridges to Prosperity](https://bridgestoprosperity.org/) and the [Better Planet Laboratory](https://betterplanetlab.com/), the dataset — available as raster files, vector files, and an [interactive map](https://apps.fikamap.com/waternet) — “triples the known extent of mapped waterways globally, adding 124 million kilometers to the previously mapped 54 million kilometers.” [h/t [Cameron Kruse](https://cameronwkruse.com/)]


__Canoe marathons.__ [Paddle UK](https://paddleuk.org.uk/)’s [Marathon Racing Committee](https://canoemarathon.org.uk/governance/marathon-racing-committee/) promotes [endurance canoe and kayak competitions](https://canoemarathon.org.uk/what-is-canoe-marathon/) that range “from a couple of miles or kilometres to the ultimate challenge of the 125-mile Devizes to Westminster Canoe Race.” The organization [publishes race results online](https://entries.canoemarathon.org.uk/results), which data scientist [Andrew Collier](https://datawookie.dev/) has [collected into structured data files](https://datawookie.gitlab.io/british-canoeing-results/) that indicate each competition’s date, name, region, and category, as well as each paddler’s name, club, division, class, finishing time, position, and points.
