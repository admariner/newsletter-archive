__Big emitters.__ [Climate TRACE](https://climatetrace.org/), a [nonprofit coalition](https://climatetrace.org/our-story) launched in 2020, uses satellite imagery, sector-specific datasets, and [other sources](https://climatetrace.org/public/upload/files/62f50cfb415f6.pdf?v=1667641844) to estimate greenhouse gas emissions in detail. Their most recent inventory, [released last week](https://climatetrace.org/news/more-than-70000-of-the-highest-emitting-greenhouse-gas), highlights 70,000+ individual sites that ‚Äúrepresent the top known sources of emissions in the power sector, oil and gas production and refining, shipping, aviation, mining, waste, agriculture, road transportation, and the production of steel, cement, and aluminum.‚Äù You can [download the data](https://climatetrace.org/downloads), [explore sector- and country-level estimates](https://climatetrace.org/inventory), and [browse a map of the sites](https://climatetrace.org/map). __Read more__: [Coverage in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/climate/climate-change-emissions-satellites.html).

__Disease outbreaks.__ [Juan Armando Torres Mungu√≠a et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01797-2) have built a [dataset of infectious disease outbreaks](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_global_dataset_of_pandemic-_and_epidemic-prone_disease_outbreaks/17207183/2), based on information extracted from the World Health Organization‚Äôs [Disease Outbreak News alerts](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news) ([DIP 2022.03.30](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-03-30-edition/)) and its [coronavirus dashboard](https://covid19.who.int/). The authors have clustered the outbreaks by disease (classified by [ICD-10](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en) and [ICD-11](https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en) codes), country, and year. Excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, this leads to 1,500+ total combinations between January 1996 and March 2022, spanning 60+ diseases and 200+ countries/territories. [h/t [Konstantin M.

__Permissively-licensed code.__ [The Stack](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack), a new dataset from the [BigCode project](https://www.bigcode-project.org/), ‚Äúcontains over 3TB of permissively-licensed source code files covering 30 programming languages crawled from GitHub.‚Äù Those terabytes hold more than 300 million files extracted from repositories whose licenses place ‚Äúminimal restrictions on how the software can be copied, modified, and redistributed.‚Äù The dataset provides the contents of each file along with its repository name, path, size, programming language, detected licenses, and several high-level metrics. __Read more__: [An introductory Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/BigCodeProject/status/1585631176353796097) and [preprint paper](https://ml4code.github.io/publications/kocetkov2022stack/).

__Impact craters.__ The [Earth Impact Database](http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/New%20website_05-2018/Index.html), maintained by the University of New Brunswick‚Äôs [Planetary and Space Science Centre](http://www.passc.net/AboutUs/index.html), catalogs nearly 200 [impact craters](http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/New%20website_05-2018/IntrotoImpacts.html) caused by meteorites that have crashed into the planet. It presents the name, location, diameter, estimated age, geology, and other features of the craters, as well as photographs and bibliographies. __Related__: [Cody Winchester](https://codywinchester.com/) has [scraped the crater characteristics into CSV and GeoJSON files](https://github.com/cjwinchester/earth-impact-data).


__Tinned fish.__ [Rainbow Tomatoes Garden](https://rainbowtomatoesgarden.com/) is a farm in East Greenville, Pennsylvania, that also happens to run an [online store](https://rainbowtomatoesgarden.com/index.php/product-category/conservas/) selling ‚Äúthe largest selection of tinned seafood in the world.‚Äù [Curator](https://rainbowtomatoesgarden.com/index.php/product/ten-tins-to-try-and-why-by-dan-waber/)-owner [Dan Waber](https://phillygrub.blog/2022/06/18/tomatoes-and-tinned-fish/) publishes a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjfwXVsGPfWw4ag3EHkT6ismDZhj8dlFwwahD7SG7gQ/edit) of the store‚Äôs 630+ offerings, [listing](https://rainbowtomatoesgarden.com/index.php/choosing-a-tin/) each product‚Äôs name, type of seafood, brand, country of origin, tin size, and price; whether it‚Äôs organic, certified kosher, smoked, boneless, and/or skinless; and more.
