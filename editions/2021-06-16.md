__Drought in the United States.__ ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôve seen it in the media: that map of the U.S. painted with blobs of yellow, orange and red. It shows drought ‚Äì but how do we know which colors go where?‚Äù [US Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/), a collaboration between the University of Nebraska and two federal agencies, [describes the process behind its weekly maps](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/About/WhatistheUSDM.aspx). Its [authors](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/About/ContactUs.aspx), who take turns drawing the drought-intensity boundaries, synthesize various sources of quantitative information ‚Äî such as the [Palmer Drought Severity Index](https://wrcc.dri.edu/wwdt/) and the [Surface Water Supply Index](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/id/snow/?cid=stelprdb1240689) ‚Äî and local knowledge. The results can be [downloaded](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Data.aspx) as geospatial files, timeseries, and summary statistics. __As seen in__: ‚Äú[How Severe Is the Western Drought? See For Yourself](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/11/climate/california-western-drought-map.html),‚Äù from the New York Times.



__Standardized testing trends.__  Stanford University‚Äôs [Educational Opportunity Project](https://edopportunity.org/) uses restricted-access data on standardized test results [to estimate trends in academic performance and learning rates](https://edopportunity.org/methods) in grades 3‚Äì8 across US schools, school districts, counties, states, and other geographies, and with respect to race, gender, and economic status. Last week the project [released v4.1](https://edopportunity.org/whats-new/) of [their public dataset](https://edopportunity.org/about/), adding estimates for Native American students and [Bureau of Indian Education](https://www.bie.edu/) schools. __As seen in__: ‚Äú[The Bureau of Indian Education Hasn‚Äôt Told the Public How Its Schools Are Performing. So We Did It Instead](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-bureau-of-indian-information-hasnt-told-the-public-how-its-schools-are-performing),‚Äù from ProPublica and the Arizona Republic, [which compiled data for the new estimates](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-performance-of-bureau-of-indian-education-schools).

__Women on high courts.__ [Maria C. Escobar-Lemmon et al.](https://womenonhighcourts.com/researchers/) have assembled a [dataset](https://womenonhighcourts.com/data/) on the representation of women in constitutional, supreme, and highest-appellate courts around the world. It lists the number and percentage of women on those courts in 175 countries (from 1970 to 2013), and indicates the first year a woman was appointed to each court (updated through 2020).

__Word origins.__ [Gerard de Melo](http://gerard.demelo.org/)‚Äôs [Etymological Wordnet](http://etym.org/) provides structured data on the relationship of words to one another, mostly mined from their semi-structured descriptions on [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) as of 2013. The dataset includes hundreds of thousands of word-origin associations, among other connections. __As seen in__: ‚Äú[Surprising shared word etymologies](https://www.danielde.dev/blog/surprising-shared-word-etymologies/),‚Äù a recent blog post by [Daniel de Haas](https://www.danielde.dev/). [h/t [Michael Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-allen-60287015b/)]


__Fox in bedroom, dog trapped in wall.__ The London Fire Brigade responds to hundreds of requests to rescue animals each year. Its monthly-updated [spreadsheet of such events](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb) goes back to 2009; it lists the location and type of property, the kind of animal and rescue, hours spent, a (very) brief description, and more.
