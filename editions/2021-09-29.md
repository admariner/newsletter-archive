*State vaccine mandates, incarceration by county, South Carolina jail deaths, marine regions, and dancing.*


__State vaccine mandates.__ The [Immunization Action Coalition](https://www.immunize.org/aboutus/) is a not-for-profit organization that “works to increase immunization rates and prevent disease by creating and distributing educational materials for healthcare professionals and the public.” Its resources include a [series of HTML tables](https://www.immunize.org/laws/) that categorize states’ school and childcare immunization mandates for more than a dozen diseases, such as [hepatitis A](https://www.immunize.org/laws/hepa.asp), [polio](https://www.immunize.org/laws/polio.asp), and [rotavirus](https://www.immunize.org/laws/rotavirus.asp). The tables, although not downloadable, can be easily pasted into spreadsheet programs. The [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/about-us/), meanwhile, is [compiling data](https://www.kff.org/report-section/state-covid-19-data-and-policy-actions-policy-actions/#vaccines) on state vaccine mandates specific to COVID-19.

__Incarceration by county.__ For an [analysis and graphics](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/09/20/there-are-fewer-people-behind-bars-now-than-10-years-ago-will-it-last) that examine changes in incarceration rates over time, reporters at the Marshall Project have [published a dataset](https://observablehq.com/@themarshallproject/adults-in-correctional-facilities-from-decennial-census) indicating the number of adults in each US county who were living in correctional facilities at the time of the Decennial Census in 2000, 2010, and 2020. Those counts, per the Census Bureau’s methodology, include a broad range of facilities, such as state prisons, military jails, halfway houses, and immigration detention centers.


__South Carolina jail deaths.__ For an [investigation](https://www.islandpacket.com/news/state/south-carolina/article252332068.html) into inmate deaths in South Carolina, [Lucas Smolcic Larson](https://twitter.com/Lucasgsl6) has [compiled a dataset](https://github.com/islandpacket/SCjaildeaths) “that aims to fill a void left by inconsistent government tracking” of these incidents. It details 253 deaths between 2009 and mid-2021, and draws from a [range of sources](https://github.com/islandpacket/SCjaildeaths#data-sources), including official forms, jail death data [compiled by Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic/) ([DIP 2020.10.21](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-10-21-edition/)) [and the Huffington Post](https://data.huffingtonpost.com/2016/jail-deaths), local media reports, and more. __Previously__: [Louisiana deaths behind bars](https://www.incarcerationtransparency.org/) ([DIP 2021.08.18](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-08-18-edition/)).


__Sea world.__ [Marine Regions](https://www.marineregions.org/), a project managed by the [Flanders Marine Institute](https://www.vliz.be/en), provides names and geographic coordinates for [62,000+](https://www.marineregions.org/content.php) sea-related places, areas, and boundaries. These [include](https://www.marineregions.org/downloads.php) exclusive economic zones, the high seas, “internal waters,” [World Marine Heritage Sites](https://www.marineregions.org/sources.php#heritage) and more, drawn from a [wide range of sources](https://www.marineregions.org/sources.php). You can also [search](https://www.marineregions.org/eezsearch.php) and [explore](https://www.marineregions.org/eezmapper.php) the maritime boundaries online.


__Dancing.__ The [AIST Dance Video Database](https://aistdancedb.ongaaccel.jp/), from Japan’s [National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology](https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_e/about_aist/), “is a shared database containing original street dance videos with copyright-cleared dance music.” It [forms the basis](https://google.github.io/aistplusplus_dataset/factsfigures.html) of Google Research’s [AIST++ Dance Motion Dataset](https://google.github.io/aistplusplus_dataset/index.html), which provides detailed annotations of 10 million images from the videos, plus “1,408 sequences of 3D human dance motion,” some of which [explore online](https://google.github.io/aistplusplus_dataset/visualizer/index.html).
