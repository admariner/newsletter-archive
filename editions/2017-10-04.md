Data Is Plural — 2017.10.04 edition
===================================

*Air quality, chest x-rays, media coverage, privately owned public spaces, and This American Life.*


__Four decades of U.S. air quality.__ The Environmental Protection Agency collects air quality samples from thousands of monitoring stations across the country. The resulting datasets, which go back to the 1980s, are available as [daily files](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data), [annual files](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html), and [via an API](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_mart_welcome.html). The monitored pollutants include ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and more. You can also download [daily Air Quality Index ratings](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#AQI) and [information about each monitoring station](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Meta). __Previously:__ Global air pollution datasets [from Berkeley Earth](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-03-22-edition) (DIP 2017.03.22) and [from the World Health Organization](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-06-15-edition) (DIP 2016.06.15).

__Chest x-rays.__ Last week, the National Institutes of Health [released a dataset](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-provides-one-largest-publicly-available-chest-x-ray-datasets-scientific-community) containing more than 100,000 anonymized chest x-rays, from 30,000 patients, “including many with advanced lung disease.” For each image, the [associated metadata](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC) includes the patient’s age, gender, and diagnosis labels. (The dataset’s authors used natural language processing to extract those labels from radiological reports; [they estimate](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC/file/220660789610) that fewer than 10% of the labels are incorrect.) __Related:__ [Andrew L. Beam’s list of medical datasets for machine learning](https://github.com/beamandrew/medical-data). [h/t [Chris Hamby](https://twitter.com/ChrisDHamby)]


__Media coverage.__ [Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org/), a collaboration between MIT and Harvard–based researchers, describes itself as “an open-source platform for studying media ecosystems.” The project lets you track topics and keywords across thousands of sources — including mainstream news publications in the U.S. and many other countries — at both a story and sentence level. You can access Media Cloud’s data via [its dashboard](https://dashboard.mediacloud.org/) or [its API](https://github.com/berkmancenter/mediacloud/blob/master/doc/api_2_0_spec/api_2_0_spec.md). Both require (free) registration. __Related:__ “[The Media Really Has Neglected Puerto Rico](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-media-really-has-neglected-puerto-rico/),” by Dhrumil Mehta at FiveThirtyEight; the analysis uses data from Media Cloud, the [TV News Archive](https://archive.org/details/tv), and [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/). __Also related:__ [The geometry of hurricane coverage](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2017/09/low-tech-visualization-how-much-space.html), as told through the front pages of The New York Times and Washington Post.


__Privately owned public spaces.__ In certain cities, private developers can earn zoning concessions by converting sections of their properties into plazas, atriums, mini-parks, and other open-to-the-public spaces. You can download datasets of these “[privately owned public spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_owned_public_space)” in [San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Privately-Owned-Public-Open-Spaces/65ik-7wqd), [Seattle](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Privately-Owned-Public-Spaces-Map/52gz-md6f), [New York City](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Housing-Development/Privately-Owned-Public-Spaces/fum3-ejky), and — thanks to a [recent collaboration between Guardian Cities and local community group](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/24/pseudo-public-space-explore-data-what-missing) — [London](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/privately-owned-public-spaces). __Related:__ [A guide to NYC’s POPS](https://apops.mas.org/find-a-pops/).

__These American Voices.__ For a new interactive essay at The Pudding, [Ash Ngu](http://stanford.edu/~ashngu/cgi-bin/) [analyzed the gender composition of This American Life episodes](https://pudding.cool/2017/09/this-american-life/). To support the findings, Ngu has published the [underlying data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KpGZzeBawsGsiYHhFgCkHFSImFlS2sdWFI4pnpUWdLQ/edit#gid=0), extracted from the show’s transcripts. Among the data extracted: the number of words spoken by each person in each act of each episode.
