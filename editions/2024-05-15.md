*üì¨ Reader¬†[Ian Johnson](https://enjalot.github.io/) has published [an exploration US federal law titles](https://enjalot.github.io/latent-scope/us-federal-laws), based on [Brian Libgober‚Äôs dataset](https://osf.io/qa289) featured in [DIP 2024.02.28](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2024-02-28-edition/).

*üì¨ Reader [Brad Skillman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-skillman-6a87b110/) helpfully flags that, alas, the [National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/about_ahcd.htm) ([featured last week](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2024-05-08-edition/)) has [ceased collecting new data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/notice.htm#anchor_1678674377785). Per the CDC: ‚ÄúAlthough NHAMCS is ending data collection, emergency department data collection and estimates will continue to be available [‚Ä¶] through the [National Hospital Care Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhcs/index.htm).‚Äù*


__Unaccompanied migrant children.__ The New York Times‚Äô [Hannah Dreier](https://www.hannahdreier.com/) was [awarded a Pulitzer Prize last week](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/hannah-dreier-new-york-times) for a ‚Äúseries of stories revealing the stunning reach of migrant child labor across the United States‚Äîand the corporate and governmental failures that perpetuate it.‚Äù That reporting, [Dreier has noted](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/insider/searching-for-the-faces-of-child-migrant-labor.html), was partly driven by [data she obtained from the Department of Health and Human Services](https://github.com/nytimes/hhs-child-migrant-data) via a FOIA request and lawsuit. The dataset, published in December [along with visualizations](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/28/us/migrants-children-data.html), describes the placement of 550,000+ unaccompanied migrant children with local sponsors between January 2015 and May 2023: each child‚Äôs country of origin, gender, date of entry, and date of release to a sponsor, plus the sponsor‚Äôs ZIP code and relationship to the child. __Read more__: ‚ÄúThe data pointed to spots I never would have thought of: Flandreau, South Dakota; Parksley, Virginia; Bozeman, Montana,‚Äù [Dreier says](https://journalistsresource.org/media/migrant-children-labor-abuse-goldmith/).


__Greenhouse gas giants.__ [Carbon Majors](https://carbonmajors.org/), run by the UK-based [InfluenceMap](https://influencemap.org/), ‚Äúis a database of historical production data from 122 of the world‚Äôs largest oil, gas, coal, and cement producers.‚Äù It attributes to these producers 1,421 metric gigatons of [CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Carbon_dioxide_equivalent) emissions from 1854 through 2022. [Launched last month](https://carbonmajors.org/briefing/The-Carbon-Majors-Database-26913), the database provides [downloads at several levels of granularity](https://carbonmajors.org/Downloads). The least granular version indicates the emissions calculated for each entity-year combination. The most granular version breaks those emissions down by commodity produced, quantity of commodity produced, emitting activity, and reporting entity.


__1 million ChatGPT conversations.__ The [WildChat Dataset](https://wildchat.allen.ai/), constructed by [Wenting Zhao et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01470), ‚Äúis a corpus of 1 million real-world user-ChatGPT interactions, characterized by a wide range of languages and a diversity of user prompts.‚Äù The researchers, primarily affiliated with Cornell and the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/), built it ‚Äúby offering free access to ChatGPT and GPT-4 in exchange for consensual chat history collection.‚Äù Each of the 1 million rows in the [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/WildChat-1M) represents a conversation and provides its text, main language, timestamp of its conclusion, underlying model used, moderation results, inferred country, and more.

__England sewage discharge.__ The UK‚Äôs Environment Agency [collects data from utility companies](https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/21e15f12-0df8-4bfc-b763-45226c16a8ac) regarding sewage-discharging [storm overflows](https://www.ofwat.gov.uk/about-us/ofwat-and-the-environment/pollution-and-water-quality/storm-overflows-explainer/) in England. The records, available for 2020‚Äì2023, list every reported overflow event, its timing and location, number of detected discharges, discharge points, and much more. __Related__: Wales overflow data are available from [other](https://corporate.dwrcymru.com/en/community/environment/event-duration-monitoring) [sources](https://www.hdcymru.co.uk/regulatory-library/regulatory-library/). __As seen in__: Maps from [The Rivers Trust](https://theriverstrust.org/sewage-map), [Surfers Against Sewage](https://www.sas.org.uk/water-quality/sewage-pollution-alerts/), and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2024/mar/27/englands-sewage-crisis-how-polluted-is-your-local-river-and-which-regions-are-worst-hit).

__Los Angeles street trees.__ Journalist [Matt Stiles](https://mattstiles.me/) has been using public records requests and official portals to compile [data on 1.6 million street trees in 40+ Los Angeles County municipalities](https://github.com/stiles/la-trees). The information varies by city but generally includes the tree‚Äôs coordinates and species, often also with measurements such as height and trunk diameter. __Previously__: Street trees in [DIP 2022.09.07](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-09-07-edition/), [DIP 2020.11.18](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-11-18-edition/), [DIP 2018.08.08](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-08-08-edition/), and [DIP 2016.11.16](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-11-16-edition/).
