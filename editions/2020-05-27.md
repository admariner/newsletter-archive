Data Is Plural — 2020.05.27 edition
===================================

*Census response rates, more excess mortality data, ranked-choice votes, Shakespeare and Company’s lending library, and seashells.*


__Census response rates.__ As it has in the past, the US Census Bureau is encouraging residents to [respond to the 2020 Census’s mailed questionnaire](https://2020census.gov/en/ways-to-respond.html), which reduces the need for in-person census-taking. The agency calculates these "self-response" rates all the way down to individual Census tracts, and provides that data [as a CSV](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/data/2020map/2020/) and via [its API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-response-rates.html). Those datasets, however, only represent the latest numbers, so researchers at the CUNY’s [Center for Urban Research](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUR) have been [creating daily snapshots](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qrwrdkmjb3fjmg5/AAAaxYr9yeU9hBQMJcggriuEa?dl=0), which they’re also [mapping and analyzing for the public](https://www.censushardtocountmaps2020.us/). __Related__: [The Center’s FAQ for the data](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Center-for-Urban-Research/CUR-research-initiatives/Census-2020-Self-Response-Data-Questions-and-Answers).

__More excess mortality data.__ [Last week’s newsletter](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-05-20-edition) featured the [data and code](https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-excess-deaths-tracker) that The Economist is using [to estimate excess deaths due to COVID-19](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/16/tracking-covid-19-excess-deaths-across-countries). Also last week: The New York Times began publishing [the data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/excess-deaths) behind its [similar-but-different estimates](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html). And earlier this month, the team at the [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/) launched its [Short-term Mortality Fluctuations data series](https://www.mortality.org/Public/STMF_DOC/STMFNote.pdf), which provides “user-friendly access to detailed data on mortality by week, sex, and aggregated age group” for more than a dozen countries.

__Ranked-choice votes.__ The website [ranked.vote](https://ranked.vote/), built by quantitative analyst [Paul Butler](https://paulbutler.org/), standardizes and visualizes the detailed results of a few dozen elections — in Maine, San Francisco, Santa Fe, and Burlington — that have used [ranked-choice voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting), where voters can list their preferred candidates in sequential order.


__Interwar literary lending.__ From 1919 to 1941, Sylvia Beach ran [Shakespeare and Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_and_Company_(bookstore)), the legendary Paris bookstore. It featured a lending library, whose members included writers such as Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Simone de Beauvoir, and Ernest Hemingway. Princeton University’s [Shakespeare and Company Project](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/) has digitized [hundreds of the library’s lending cards and logbooks](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/sources/), and has made the data available to [explore](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/members/) and [download](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/about/data/).

__Seashells.__ A team of researchers [has built](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0230-3) a dataset that characterizes 29,622 samples of shells from 7,894 water-dwelling species. You can [search the shell images online](http://www.cis.um.edu.mo/research/shelldataset/) and also [download the full dataset](https://springernature.figshare.com/collections/A_shell_dataset_for_shell_features_extraction_and_recognition/4428335).
