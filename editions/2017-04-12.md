Data Is Plural — 2017.04.12 edition
===================================

*Plum presidential appointments, fuel efficiency, pirated papers, aid for maternal health, and one million comic book panels.*

&nbsp;

**Plum presidential appointments.** Every four years, Congress publishes *United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions*, better known as the Plum Book. The 2016 version, which is [available as both PDF and Excel files](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2016/content-detail.html), identifies more than 8,000 executive and legislative branch jobs subject to “noncompetitive appointment.” Those positions include 1,710 presidential appointments, which are as wide-ranging as the ambassadorship to Afghanistan and the directorship of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Whistleblower Protection Program. **Related:** For positions requiring its confirmation, the Senate publishes [XML files of pending, confirmed, and withdrawn nominees](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/nominations.htm).

&nbsp;

**Miles per gallon.** The Environmental Protection Agency publishes [fuel efficiency data on all the car models it has tested](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml), going back to the 1980s… minus all the Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche diesels caught cheating. The data typically includes three estimates: for city driving, highway driving, and a city-highway combination.

&nbsp;

**Pirated papers.** [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.cc/), which describes itself as “the first pirate website in the world to provide mass and public access to tens of millions of research papers,” recently released [a list of the 62,835,101 academic papers it has collected](https://figshare.com/articles/List_of_DOIs_of_papers_collected_by_SciHub/4765477). That dataset identifies each paper only by its [DOI](http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/what-is-doi.aspx) — a short, unique ID. Helpfully, graduate student [Bastian Greshake](http://ruleofthirds.de/) has [extracted the journal name, publisher, and publication ear](https://zenodo.org/record/472493) from those DOIs. Greshake has also combined that data with [six months of Sci-Hub download data](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.q447c) (previously featured in [DIP 2016.05.04](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-05-04-edition)), and [analyzed the datasets together](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/10/124495). Among his findings: Both are “largely made up of recently published articles, with users disproportionately favoring newer articles and 35% of downloaded articles being published after 2013.”

&nbsp;

**International aid for maternal and child health.** Researchers at the World Health Organization have [assembled a dataset](http://datacompass.lshtm.ac.uk/320/) of international aid — both from official government assistance and private grants — devoted to reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health from 2003 to 2013. The dataset, which the researchers described in a [recent academic article](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201738), draws on 2.1 million records, and is based largely on the [OECD’s Creditor Reporting System](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?datasetcode=CRS1). **Related:** Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department [cut all its funding for the UN's family planning agency](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jinamoore/the-us-wont-give-any-more-money-to-the-un-population-fund); it was the agency’s third-largest donor.

&nbsp;

**One million comic book panels.** Comic books make use of white space — or gutters — to propel the story forward, relying on readers’ intuitive ability to fill in the gaps between panels. To see whether computers could learn to make the same inferences, a group of computer scientists built a giant corpus of public-domain comics and [tried training a series of neural networks on it](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05118). (Spoiler: Humans are much better at this.) The [underlying dataset](https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/comics/index.html) contains 1.2 million panels from nearly 200,000 scanned pages of nearly 4,000 books in the [Digital Comic Museum](https://digitalcomicmuseum.com/), all published during the 1938–1954 “Golden Age” of American comics. It also contains 2.5 million chunks of text extracted from the comics’ speech balloons, thought bubbles, and narration boxes. [h/t [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/)]
