Data Is Plural — 2019.04.03 edition
===================================

*Yemen air strikes, teacher supply, moralizing gods, mid-Atlantic shorelines, and the Index Thomisticus.*


__Yemen air strikes.__ To mark the four-year anniversary of the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen, the [Yemen Data Project](http://yemendataproject.org/) last week [released civilian casualty estimates for the entire air war](https://twitter.com/YemenData/status/1110285476244520960). The project’s researchers [collect and cross-reference data](http://yemendataproject.org/methodology-1.html) from a range of sources, including news reports, social media, video footage, local authorities, and NGOs; their [published data](http://yemendataproject.org/data.html) contains dates, locations, and casualty estimates for more than 19,000 air raids. __As seen in:__ “[Saudi Strikes, American Bombs, Yemeni Suffering: How Saudi Arabia’s war tactics have fueled Yemen’s humanitarian crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/27/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-war-tactics-yemen-humanitarian-crisis.html)” (New York Times, December 2018).

__Teacher supply.__ The UNESCO Institute of Statistics collects country-level data on the number of teachers, teacher-to-student ratios, and related figures. You can [download the data](http://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?queryid=180) or explore it in UNESCO’s [eAtlas of Teachers](https://tellmaps.com/uis/teachers/#!/tellmap/873758989) or their [interactive visualization of teacher supply in Asia](http://uis.unesco.org/misc/uis/teachers.html).


__Moralizing gods.__ To test the “moralizing gods” hypothesis (which posits that “belief in morally concerned supernatural agents culturally evolved to facilitate cooperation among strangers in large-scale societies”), [the authors](http://seshatdatabank.info/nature-paper-on-moralizing-gods/) of a [recent paper in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1043-4) “coded records from 414 societies that span the past 10,000 years from 30 regions around the world, using 51 measures of social complexity and 4 measures of supernatural enforcement of morality.” The dataset is [available to download](http://seshatdatabank.info/datasets/). __Findings:__ “Our analyses not only confirm the association between moralizing gods and social complexity, but also reveal that moralizing gods follow — rather than precede — large increases in social complexity.” [h/t [Juan Moreno-Cruz](https://twitter.com/jmorenocruz/status/1111720070068080640) + [Peter Irvine](https://twitter.com/peteirvine/status/1111362490229764097)]


__Mid-Atlantic shorelines.__ The [Virginia Institute of Marine Science](https://www.vims.edu/) at The College of William & Mary maintains [shoreline inventories](https://www.vims.edu/ccrm/research/inventory/index.php) for Virginia, Maryland, and parts of Delaware and North Carolina. The datasets include geospatial information about land use, vegetation, different types of structures (e.g., jetties, bulkheads, docks, boathouses), and more.

__The Index Thomisticus.__ “In 1949, an Italian Jesuit priest named Roberto Busa presented a pitch to Thomas J. Watson, of I.B.M.,” according to [a New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/24/what-the-enron-e-mails-say-about-us) principally about [the Enron email archive](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-07-26-edition). “Busa was trained in philosophy, and had just published his thesis on St. Thomas Aquinas, the Catholic theologian with a famously unmanageable œuvre.” Watson agreed to help, “and, for the next thirty years, Busa encoded sixty-five thousand pages of Thomist text so that it could be word-searched, cross-referenced, and what we now call hyperlinked.” The Index Thomisticus became “the first corpus to be primed for digital scholarship,” and is available online to [search](http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/index.age) and [download](https://itreebank.marginalia.it/view/download.php).
