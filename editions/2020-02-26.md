Data Is Plural — 2020.02.26 edition
===================================

*Government contracts, tech organizing, US anti-press incidents, EU laws, and Cockatoo Island prisoners.*


__Government contracts, standardized.__ The [Open Contracting Data Standard](https://www.open-contracting.org/data-standard/) is a “free, non-proprietary open data standard” that makes it “easier to share, compare and analyze” the contracts that governments award to bidders. The project [has been gaining traction](https://www.open-contracting.org/impact-stories/), with [dozens of local and federal governments](https://www.open-contracting.org/worldwide/) using [the standard](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/) to publish detailed official data, including in [the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-contracting), [Canada](https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/open-contracting-data-standard-pilot/about-the-ocds-pilot), [Colombia](https://www.colombiacompra.gov.co/transparencia/gestion-documental/datos-abiertos), [Nepal](http://ppip.gov.np), [Uganda](https://gpp.ppda.go.ug), and [Afghanistan](https://ageops.net/en/home).


__Tech workers, united.__ The [Collective Actions In Tech project](https://collectiveactions.tech) database aims to document every instance of tech-industry workers banding together to raise awareness of a shared cause. The database, which is [developed collaboratively](https://github.com/collective-action/tech/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [available to download](https://github.com/collective-action/tech), so far contains more than 200 protests, strikes, union drives, legal actions, and open letters. (The earliest event: In 1979, IBM workers protested their company’s business with apartheid South Africa.) __Related__: Writing for The Guardian, [two of the project’s organizers describe](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/22/tech-worker-activism-2019-what-we-learned) “our eight most important insights.” [h/t [anjakefala](https://anja.kefala.info)]


__Anti-press incidents.__ Since 2017, the [U.S. Press Freedom Tracker](https://pressfreedomtracker.us) has collected information on [more than 400 incidents targeting journalists in the United States](https://pressfreedomtracker.us/blog/3-years-tracking-our-january-2020-newsletter/), such as arrests, attacks, and denials of access. The [initiative](https://pressfreedomtracker.us/about/), led by the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/) and the [Committee to Protect Journalists](https://www.cpj.org/), provides [bulk downloads of the data, plus an API](https://pressfreedomtracker.us/data/). __Related__: The project [also maintains](https://pressfreedomtracker.us/blog/back-campaign-trail-president-trump-increases-his-anti-press-tweet-offensive/) a [spreadsheet of anti-press tweets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uNA6nsgcRhhQ0b6USsMNzhYLMfuDRSMhbGZNZ00WkHk/edit?usp=sharing) by Donald Trump. __Previously__: CPJ’s [database of journalists who’ve been killed](https://cpj.org/data/killed) for reasons related to their work ([DIP 2019.01.16](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-01-16-edition)).

__EU laws.__ The [CEPS EurLex dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/0EGYWY) contains more than 142,000 European Union regulations, directives, and official decisions — ”almost the entire corpus of the EU’s legally binding acts passed between 1952 - 2019.” The dataset contains two dozen variables, including dates, subject matter, authors, various links, and the full text of most laws. The information comes, ultimately, from the EU’s online legal repository, [eur-lex.europa.eu](https://eur-lex.europa.eu).

__Cockatoo Island prisoners.__ Historical criminologist [Katherine Roscoe](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/sociology-social-policy-and-criminology/staff/katherine-roscoe/) has transcribed archival records to create a [detailed dataset of more than 2,500 people imprisoned](https://cockatooconvicts.wordpress.com) between 1847 and 1869 at [Cockatoo Island Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockatoo_Island_(New_South_Wales)) — “Sydney’s most notorious 19th century prison,” now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
