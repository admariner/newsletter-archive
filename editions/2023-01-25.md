Data Is Plural — 2023.01.25 edition
===================================

*More recalls, jazz solos, overdose-related “Good Samaritan” laws, upcoming weather, and cats on the move.*


__More recalls.__ [DIP 2023.01.11](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-01-11-edition/) featured [vehicle recall data](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls) from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Other US federal agencies publishing recall data include the Food and Drug Administration, whose [dataset](https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/cd/recalls.htm) contains 81,000+ entries related to food, drugs, medical devices, and related products going back to 2012; the Consumer Product Safety Commission, whose [database](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls) spans 8,500+ recalls since 1973; and the Coast Guard, whose [listing of 1,600+ boat recalls](https://uscgboating.org/content/recalls.php) is not downloadable but seems possible to scrape. __Also__: Vehicle recall data from [Canadian](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/1ec92326-47ef-4110-b7ca-959fab03f96d) and [UK](https://www.check-vehicle-recalls.service.gov.uk/recall-type/vehicle/make) regulators. __Previously__: [International medical device recalls](https://medicaldevices.icij.org/p/about) from ICIJ’s [Implant Files](https://medicaldevices.icij.org/) ([DIP 2019.04.17](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-04-17-edition/)).


__Jazz solos.__ The [Jazzomat Research Project](https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/), hosted at the [University of Music Franz Liszt Weimar](https://www.hfm-weimar.de/en/start), aims “to investigate the creative processes underlying jazz solo improvisations with the help of statistical and computational methods.” The project’s [main database](https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/dbformat/dboverview.html) contains transcriptions and analyses of [450+ solos](https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/dbformat/dbcontent.html) by John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, and dozens of other artists. The [downloadable](https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/download/download.html) version [includes](https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/dbformat/dbformat.html) each “event” in each solo: its pitch, loudness, time of onset, duration, and more. __As seen in__: “[What makes that song swing? At last, physicists unravel a jazz mystery](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/01/18/1139783203/what-makes-songs-swing-physicists-unravel-jazz-mystery)” (NPR).

__Overdose-related “Good Samaritan” laws.__ [Shane W. Reader et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955395922003127) have [compiled data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/r65b6hrdhm/2) on US state laws that “prevent or mitigate criminal consequences for activities pertaining to controlled substances for persons who call 911 to report a drug overdose.” Their dataset spans April 2007 to June 2022 and covers all 50 states, plus DC. The details include the types of people protected (e.g., the person overdosing, the caller, self-reporters), the kinds of protection conferred (e.g., with regard to arrests, charges, sentencing), the types of violations protected, and more.


__Upcoming weather.__ [Alexander Rey](https://alexanderrey.ca/)’s [Pirate Weather](https://pirateweather.net/) aims to be a “drop in replacement” for [DarkSky’s weather forecast API](https://darksky.net/dev), [which is shutting down](https://blog.darksky.net/dark-sky-has-a-new-home/). It pulls data from [several NOAA forecast models](https://docs.pirateweather.net/en/latest/#data-sources) in order to provide minute-level, hourly, and daily predictions of temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, and more. __Note__: The API is free to use but is limited to 20,000 calls per month. __Related__: Pirate Weather powers [Merry Sky](https://merrysky.net/), a website [built](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/tech/article/dwight-silverman-dark-sky-merry-sky-17728129.php) by [Guillaume Carbonneau](https://github.com/guillaume).

__Cats on the move.__ Between 2013 and 2017, [Roland Kays et al.](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acv.12563) convinced hundreds of volunteers in the [US](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.885), [UK](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.882), [Australia](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.876), and [New Zealand](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.879) to strap GPS sensors on their pet cats. The aforelinked datasets include each cat’s characteristics (such as age, sex, neuter status, hunting habits) and timestamped GPS pings. __Related__: [CatTracker.org](https://cattracker.org/), the homepage for the US branch of the project, features a [cat-track browser](https://cattracker.org/tracks/). __Previously__: [Cat meows](https://zenodo.org/record/4008297#.Y86t4uLMI-Q) ([DIP 2021.06.30](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-06-30-edition/)).
