Data Is Plural — 2016.05.04 edition
===================================

*Pirated papers, the Ku Klux Klan, disciplined doctors, goooooooooaaaaals, and grape harvests.*

&nbsp;

**Scientific paper trails.** [Sci-Hub](http://sci-hub.cc/) bills itself as “the first pirate website in the world to provide mass and public access to tens of millions of research papers.” Who’s downloading papers from the site? “[Everyone](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/whos-downloading-pirated-papers-everyone),” *Science* magazine concluded after analyzing [data culled from six months of Sci-Hub server logs](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.q447c). For every download, the dataset identifies the paper downloaded, the date and time, an anonymized version of the downloader’s IP address, and a rough location.

**The Ku Klux Klan, 1915–1940.** Scholars at Virginia Commonwealth University have identified and [mapped](http://labs.library.vcu.edu/klan/) the [locations of 2,000 KKK branches](http://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/hist_data/1/) active in the early 20th century. The dataset contains the city, state, earliest-known-date, and sources for each “klavern.” **Related:** “[Active Hate Groups in the United States in 2015](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2016/active-hate-groups-united-states-2015),” a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

&nbsp;

**Disciplined doctors.** The [National Practitioner Data Bank](http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/) tracks medical malpractice payments, license suspensions, Medicare expulsions, and other lists of penalized physicians. The [public use data file](http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/resources/publicData.jsp) includes dozens of details per entry but excludes the part that is almost certainly most important to patients: the doctors' names. **Related:** “[Doctors perform thousands of unnecessary surgeries](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/18/unnecessary-surgery-usa-today-investigation/2435009/),” according to a 2013 *USA Today* investigation that relied partly on the NPDB.

&nbsp;

**Goooooooooaaaaal.** [OpenFootball](http://openfootball.github.io/) collects and publishes results and rosters from national and international soccer/football matches, including the Premier League and the World Cup. **Related:** [English soccer/football results, 1871–2014](https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata).

**Grape timing.** Climate scientists have compiled a [dataset of grape-harvest-dates](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo/f?p=519:1:0::::P1_STUDY_ID:13194) from 380 European vineyards, across 27 regions, and stretching back 650 years. The earliest data-point refers to a Burgundy harvest in 1354. **Related:** [The original academic paper](http://www.clim-past.net/8/1403/2012/). [h/t [Martín González](https://twitter.com/martgnz)]
