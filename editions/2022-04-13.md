===================================

*Constitutions, EU asylum, critical infrastructure density, Brazilian news outlets, and carnivore diets.*


__Constitutions.__ The [Comparative Constitutions Project](https://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/), a nonprofit originally [launched at the University of Illinois in 2005](https://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/about-ccp/), “produces comprehensive data about the world’s constitutions.” Its [downloadable datasets](https://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/download-data/) cover both [chronology](https://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/chronology/) (years of creation, amendment, dissolution, and other events from 1789 to 2019) and characteristics (hundreds of variables on topics ranging from citizenship and electoral oversight to whether the text discusses a national flag or motto). A sibling site, [Constitute](https://www.constituteproject.org/), provides [annotated text of all national constitutions currently in force](https://constituteproject.org/constitutions?lang=en&status=in_force), as well as [Linked Data files and an API](https://www.constituteproject.org/content/data?lang=en). __As seen in__: [André Borges](https://andreborges.org/)’s [dataset tracking presidential powers in 79 democracies with elected presidents](https://andreborges.org/datasets/).

__EU asylum.__ The European Union [requires members to submit](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/migr_asyapp_esms.htm) a range of asylum-related figures to [Eurostat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostat), which it then [compiles into standardized datasets](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/popul?lang=en&subtheme=migr.migr_asy). These include monthly and annual counts of asylum applications submitted, pending, withdrawn, processed under the EU’s “accelerated procedure,” and filed by unaccompanied minors, disaggregated by age, sex, and citizenship. __As seen in__: “[Europe welcomes Ukrainian refugees with an asylum system that averages more than 15 months of delay](https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Is-the-EU-s-asylum-system-ready-to-welcome-Ukrainian-refugees),” published by Civio.es, with [data](https://datos.civio.es/dataset/meses-de-retraso-en-la-resolucion-de-solicitudes-de-asilo-en-la-ue/) and an [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@civio/682-backlog-in-asylum-applications-in-the-european-union-as).

__Critical infrastructure density.__ [Sadhana Nirandjan et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01218-4) have developed “a first-of-its-kind globally harmonized spatial dataset” representing the density of critical infrastructure, built with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data (and [noting its limitations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01218-4#Sec16)). The researchers selected 39 kinds of structures (railways, landfills, pharmacies, etc.), grouped into seven categories: education, energy, health, telecommunication, transportation, waste, and water. Then they [calculated](https://github.com/snirandjan/CISI) those categories’ [concentrations at 0.10°- and 0.25°-grid resolutions](https://zenodo.org/record/4957647). __Previously__: [US infrastructure, from the Department of Homeland Security](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/) ([DIP 2016.03.02](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-03-02-edition/)).

__Brazilian news outlets.__ [Atlas da Notícia](https://www.atlas.jor.br/) (⎘[English homepage](https://www.atlas.jor.br/en/)) aims to catalog Brazil’s print, online, television, and radio news outlets. Created by the [Instituto para o Desenvolvimento do Jornalismo](https://www.projor.org.br/en) and [Volt Data Lab](https://voltdata.info/en/), the [dataset’s 14,000+ entries](https://www.atlas.jor.br/dados/app/) list each outlet’s name, medium, distribution frequency, municipality, state, open/closed status, and (in some cases) approximate staff size.

__Carnivore diets.__ [Owen Middleton et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13296)’s [CarniDIET 1.0](https://github.com/osmiddleton/CarniDIET-Database) provides “data on the diet compositions for 103 species of terrestrial, carnivorous mammals from (mostly) peer-reviewed scientific papers.” Each of its 29,000+ rows represents a “diet record,” describing a component of the species’ consumption, for a particular population, geography, and study.
