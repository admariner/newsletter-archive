===================================

*Monkeypox cases, Ukraine air raid alerts, central bank interest rates, inclusive crossword names, and NYC tree plantings.*


*üëã As some eagle-eyed readers have noticed, last month I started syndicating Data Is Plural at [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/series/data-is-plural) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/data-is-plural/). I‚Äôm enjoying the experiment and I‚Äôd like to try expanding the roster. If you‚Äôre interested, [get in touch](https://www.jsvine.com/).*


__Monkeypox cases.__ [Global.health](https://global.health/), a [data-sharing initiative](https://global.health/about/) launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, has compiled a [dataset of 2,500+ confirmed cases](https://github.com/globaldothealth/monkeypox) from this year‚Äôs [monkeypox outbreak](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON385). Drawing from government and media sources, the [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEBhao3rMe-qtCbAgJTn5ZKQMRFWeAeaiXFpBY3gbHE/edit#gid=0) lists each case‚Äôs country and publicly known characteristics, such as the patient‚Äôs gender, age range, date of confirmation, and/or symptoms. __As seen in__: [Charts and maps from the Global.health team](https://www.monkeypox.global.health/) and [from Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/monkeypox).


__Ukraine air raid alerts.__ [Volodymyr Agafonkin](https://agafonkin.com/), a Kyiv-based software engineer, has been [scraping and charting](https://observablehq.com/@mourner/sirens) the emergency notifications published through [Air Alert Ukraine](https://t.me/air_alert_ua), a Telegram channel. The notifications serve as a digital counterpart to the sirens that warn residents of potentially-imminent Russian air attacks. Agafonkin‚Äôs [dataset](https://observablehq.com/@mourner/sirens#data) indicates the starting and ending times of 8,000+ alerts for 240 locations since March 15. __Read more__: [An interview with Agafonkin](https://s2.washingtonpost.com/camp-rw/?s=62addaedcfe8a21601b1353a) in [How To Read This Chart](https://www.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/how-to-read-this-chart/), a Washington Post newsletter.


__Central bank interest rates.__ The [Bank for International Settlements](https://www.bis.org/about/index.htm) maintains a [longitudinal dataset](https://www.bis.org/statistics/cbpol.htm) of [policy interest rates](https://www.focus-economics.com/economic-indicator/policy-interest-rate), which central banks adjust to influence inflation and other aspects of the economy. The dataset, which includes both official policy rates and analogous precursors, covers three dozen countries plus the European Central Bank. The records span decades, going as far back as 1946 for Denmark, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK; 1954 for the US; 1960 for Canada; and 1976 for Australia.


__Inclusive crossword names.__ In a [post](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/crosswords/wojcik-diverse-crossword-puzzles.html) for [The New York Times‚Äô Gameplay section](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/18/crosswords/introducing-gameplay.html), psychology professor [Erica Hsiung Wojcik](https://twitter.com/ewojcik) describes her motivations for creating the [Expanded Crossword Name Database](https://sites.google.com/view/expandedcrosswordnamedatabase/home), ‚Äúa free and regularly updated list of names, places and things that represent groups, identities and people often excluded from crossword grids,‚Äù with a particular focus on ‚Äúnames of women, non-binary, trans, and/or people of color.‚Äù It contains 2,400+ potential entries ‚Äî from AALIYAH to ZORANEALEHURSTON ‚Äî that correspond to 900+ distinct proper nouns, each briefly described in the project‚Äôs [main spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fc6thrwFTPKwP0PlBTvzKjfiGlnM37JXLPaR8_In3fw/edit#gid=578940851).

__NYC tree plantings.__ New York City‚Äôs Department of Parks & Recreation publishes a [map and dataset](https://www.nycgovparks.org/trees/street-tree-planting/locations) of recent and likely-upcoming street tree plantings. The information includes each location‚Äôs coordinates, nearest street address, ZIP code, city council district, and borough, as well as the dates of completed plantings. __Previously__: [Every street tree in NYC](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/) ([DIP 2016.11.16](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-11-16-edition/)).
