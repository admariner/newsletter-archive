Data Is Plural — 2016.02.10 edition
===================================

*Power plants, nature observations, organ transplants, more political ads, and one million songs.*

&nbsp;

**Powering America.** Every year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration requires thousands of power plants to report [detailed data on fuel consumption and electricity generation](http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/). The datasets stretch back more than three decades, to 1989. In 2014, the most recent year available, Arizona’s [Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Verde_Nuclear_Generating_Station) generated more electricity — 32 million megawatt hours — than any other power plant in the country.

**Nature-spotting.** [iNaturalist](http://www.inaturalist.org/pages/about) is a sort of social network for nature enthusiasts. Users can post photos and descriptions of birds, fish, bugs, and [even mold](http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/2656845), which experts can then help to identify. In November, the site [recorded its two-millionth observation](http://inaturalist.tumblr.com/post/133980888898/2-million-observations). You can explore [the data via API](http://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference) or, with a free account, use [the site’s export tool](http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/export).

**Organ transplants.** The [Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network](https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/), a public-private partnership, [keeps records](https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/latestData/viewDataReports.asp) of organ donations, transplants, and waiting lists in the United States. The website’s [“advanced” data tool](https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/latestData/advancedData.asp) lets you generate fairly detailed custom reports. One hitch: The site doesn’t provide an option to download the data. Data Is Plural wrote [a small bit of software to fix that](https://gist.github.com/jsvine/6ed721172a7f5019332b).

&nbsp;

**More political ads.** The Internet Archive’s [Political TV Ad Archive](http://politicaladarchive.org/) uses audio fingerprinting to identify the campaign ads playing in key primary states. You can search the database, watch the ads, and [download the data](http://politicaladarchive.org/data/). The data file contains information about each ad’s sponsor, pro/con-ness, TV network, and time of airing. **Previously:** [Political Ad Sleuth](http://politicaladsleuth.com/), [featured Jan. 20](http://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-01-20-edition).

&nbsp;

**One million songs.** The [Million Song Database](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) contains [metadata and “feature analysis”](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/example-track-description) (e.g., loudness, tempo, and “danceability”) for, you guessed it, one thousand-thousand songs. The [full dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/getting-dataset) occupies hundreds of gigabytes, but you can also download a 1% sample.
