*Global military spending, fatal police pursuits, price-fixing cartels, real-time airport disruptions, and pinball machines.*


*üì¨ Reader¬†[Nick Hillman](https://financialaid.wisc.edu/staff/hillman-nick/)‚Äôs¬†[research team](https://sstar.wisc.edu/our-team/)¬†at the University of Wisconsin uses data from the federal government‚Äôs Daily¬†Treasury¬†Statements ([DIP¬†2023.04.05](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-04-05-edition/)) to¬†[track the estimated volume of student loan payments](https://sstar.wisc.edu/student-loan-repayment/)¬†over time. Although Nick learned about that data via non-DIP sources, the project is exactly the type I like to feature in these notes. (Have you published something with data you found via DIP?¬†[Click here to let me know](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXXD5eO05w0Xa7bwG3Ppia3uzr_o3y-xDEZuWRfXbCfCu_XA/viewform).)*

__Global military spending.__ How much money has each country spent, each year, on its military? Different datasets have different answers, cover different timeframes, and use different methodologies. [Miriam Barnum et al.](https://osf.io/pkxt8)‚Äôs [Global Military Spending Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DHMZOW) attempts to bring them together. By uniting ‚Äú76 variables from 9 dataset collection projects,‚Äù the authors write, ‚Äúwe provide the most comprehensive and complete set of published datasets on military spending ever assembled.‚Äù Each of the variables represents one source/methodology, and each observation is a country-year. ‚ÄúDisagreement on the actual expenditure value for a given country-year is common, even between datasets produced by the same project,‚Äù they find. __Previously__: The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute‚Äôs [Military Expenditure Database](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex) ([DIP 2017.03.29](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-03-29-edition/)), one of the sources.


__Fatal police pursuits.__ Reporters at the San Francisco Chronicle have compiled a [national dataset](https://github.com/sfchronicle/police_pursuits) of 3,300+ deaths in police car chases in 2017‚Äì2022. [To build it](https://www.sfchronicle.com/us-world/article/police-chases-methodology-18685158.php), they used information from the federal government‚Äôs [Fatality Analysis Reporting System](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars) ([DIP 2016.08.31](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-08-31-edition/)), research organizations, news reports, lawsuits, and public records requests. For each death, the dataset indicates the person‚Äôs name, age, gender, race, and connection to the pursuit (driver, passenger, bystander, officer). It also includes the incident‚Äôs date, location, reason given for the pursuit, and main law enforcement agency involved. __Read more__: ‚Äú[Fast and Fatal](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2024/police-chases-database/?hash=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2ZjaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL3Byb2plY3RzLzIwMjQvcG9saWNlLWNoYXNlcy1kYXRhYmFzZS8%3D&time=MTcwOTEzNDk3Mzc4OA%3D%3D),‚Äù the Chronicle‚Äôs investigation based on the dataset.

__Price-fixing cartels.__ Industrial economist [John M. Connor](https://www.concurrences.com/en/auteur/John-M-Connor) has [constructed](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3682189) the [Private International Cartels dataset](https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/2732/2), ‚Äúwhich the author believes to be the largest collection of legal-economic information on contemporary price-fixing cartels.‚Äù It spans three decades (1990‚Äì2019) and covers 1,500+ suspected or convicted cartels, including 1,100+ that ‚Äúhave been deemed guilty of price fixing by one or more antitrust authority.‚Äù It also links those cartels to tens of thousands of companies and to 2,000+ individuals indicted or punished for their involvement. The dataset‚Äôs variables include information about cartel geography, industry, market share, overcharges, penalties, and much more.


__Real-time airport disruptions.__ The Federal Aviation Administration‚Äôs [National Airspace System Status](https://nasstatus.faa.gov/) dashboard provides real-time listings of delays and closures at US airports. For each disruption, it indicates the type of problem, reason, current average delay times, and more. A minimal API linked from the site provides [the information as an XML-formatted file](https://nasstatus.faa.gov/api/airport-status-information). __Read more__: [Ruihai Youngblood describes his experience helping to redesign the dashboard](https://www.ruihaiyoungblood.com/faa.html). [h/t [Jason Scott](https://bsky.app/profile/textfiles.com/post/3k2l2eesr2h2w)]


__Pinball machines.__ The [Open Pinball Database](https://opdb.org/) provides a searchable inventory and [API](https://opdb.org/api) of [~2,000 pinball machines](https://opdb.org/machines) and [120+ manufacturers](https://opdb.org/manufacturers). Details include each machine‚Äôs name, manufacture date, mechanism type, display type, player count, and more. __Related__: [Pinball Map](https://pinballmap.com/)‚Äôs crowdsourced [global map](https://pinballmap.com/map) and [API](https://pinballmap.com/api/v1/docs) of the locations of installed pinball machines.
