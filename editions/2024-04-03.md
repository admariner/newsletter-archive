Data Is Plural ‚Äî 2024.04.03 edition
===================================

*Power outages, European Parliament activity, candid animals, LLM data provenance, and deaths in plague-era London.*


*üîÑ Earlier this year, the USDA released the 2022 edition of its [Census of Agriculture](https://www.nass.usda.gov/AgCensus/), initially featured in [DIP 2015.12.23](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2015-12-23-edition/). National, state, and county data are [available to download](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2022/index.php). Data for Puerto Rico are coming in July, and for the rest of US territories in 2025. [h/t [Jasmine Mithani](https://jmithani.com/)]*

__Power outages.__ [Christa Brelsford et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03095-5) have compiled a [county-level estimates of the number of US customers experiencing power outages](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/The_Environment_for_Analysis_of_Geo-Located_Energy_Information_s_Recorded_Electricity_Outages_2014-2022/24237376) at 15-minute intervals from 2014 to 2023. The records come from [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory)‚Äôs restricted-access [Environment for Analysis of Geo-Located Energy Information](https://www.energy.gov/oe/articles/doe-announces-transition-eagle-i-oak-ridge-national-laboratory-ornl-taking-advantage), a ‚Äúplatform created to monitor electric utility customer outages from data gathered from public sources.‚Äù The data‚Äôs coverage has increased over time; by 2022, it represented 92% of customers in the 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. ‚ÄúThe remaining 8% of customers belong to utilities which do not report outage information publicly in near-real time in a format that is currently accessible to EAGLE-I parsers,‚Äù the authors write. ‚ÄúThese are most typically small, rural, municipal utilities which lack robust information technology infrastructure.‚Äù


__European Parliament activity.__ [Parltrack](https://parltrack.org/) keeps tabs on 4,000+ active and prior members of the European Parliament, 23,000+ policy dossiers, 39,000+ votes, and much more. The project, launched in 2011, scrapes data from various official websites and links it together ‚Äî so that you can see, for example, [any given member‚Äôs dossiers](https://parltrack.org/mep/118859/Roberta%20METSOLA#/dossiers), [committee roles](https://parltrack.org/mep/125106/Johan%20VAN%20OVERTVELDT#/committees), and [activities](https://parltrack.org/mep/96864/David%20Maria%20SASSOLI#/activities) such as plenary speeches and proposed legislative amendments. Its [bulk datasets](https://parltrack.eu/dumps) are updated daily and include details beyond what the online interfaces offer.

__Candid animals.__ The [Labeled Information Library of Alexandria](https://lila.science/) data repository is ‚Äúintended as a resource for both machine learning (ML) researchers and those that want to harness ML for biology and conservation.‚Äù Its [datasets](https://lila.science/datasets) include millions of images, mostly captured by [motion-triggered cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_trap). Its [North American Camera Trap Images](https://lila.science/datasets/nacti) dataset, for instance, ‚Äúcontains 3.7M camera trap images from five locations across the United States, with labels for 28 animal categories, primarily at the species level.‚Äù __Read more__: ‚Äú[Machine learning to classify animal species in camera trap images: Applications in ecology](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13120).‚Äù [h/t [Corin Faife](https://corinfaife.co/)]


__LLM data provenance.__ The [Data Provenance Initiative](https://www.dataprovenance.org/) ‚Äúis a multi-disciplinary volunteer effort to improve transparency, documentation, and responsible use of training datasets for AI.‚Äù Its first release, the [Data Provenance Collection](https://github.com/Data-Provenance-Initiative/Data-Provenance-Collection), [catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16787) dozens of corpora used for [fine-tuning large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_\(deep_learning\)), as well as their component datasets‚Äô names, task categories, known sources, licensing, various text metrics, and more. __Related__: Yang Liu et al.‚Äôs ‚Äú[Datasets for Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18041),‚Äù [accompanied by semi-structured descriptions](https://github.com/lmmlzn/Awesome-LLMs-Datasets) of hundreds of training and evaluation datasets.

__Deaths in plague-era London.__ [Death by Numbers](https://deathbynumbers.org/), also known as the *Bills of Mortality Project*, [aims](https://deathbynumbers.org/about/) to [transcribe](https://datascribe.tech/casestudies/DataScribe_BillsOfMortality_CaseStudy.pdf) ~8,000 official weekly tallies of deaths in London published in the 1600s and 1700s. Initially focused on plague deaths, the reports expanded to ‚Äúdozens of other causes of death, such as childbirth, measles, syphilis, and suicide, ensuring their continued publication for decades after the final outbreak of plague in England.‚Äù The project‚Äôs data are available to [browse online](https://deathbynumbers.org/database/), to [download](https://deathbynumbers.org/data/), and [via API](https://deathbynumbers.org/api/).
