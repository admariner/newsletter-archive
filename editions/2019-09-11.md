Data Is Plural — 2019.09.11 edition
===================================

*Protected lands, city street speeds, London bike infrastructure, deaths on the job, and bug fixes.*


__Protected lands.__ The UN’s [World Database on Protected Areas](https://www.protectedplanet.net/) is, [it says](https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/about), “the most up to date and complete source of information on protected areas, updated monthly with submissions from governments, non-governmental organizations, landowners and communities.” It contains structured, geospatial information on more than 245,000 nature reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other kinds of conservation sites. The project provides bulk downloads, an interactive map, [country-level statistics](https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/unep-regions), and [an API](https://api.protectedplanet.net/). __Previously:__ [The California Protected Areas Database](https://www.calands.org/cpad/) ([DIP 2019.07.10](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-07-10-edition/)). [h/t [Giuseppe Sollazzo](https://mailchi.mp/3eeacdf7fd0a/preview-222-in-other-news-3740637)]


__City street speeds and travel times.__ [Uber Movement](https://movement.uber.com/), from the titular ride-hailing company, “shares anonymized data aggregated from over ten billion trips to help urban planning around the world.” Online, you can explore street speeds and estimated travel times for dozens of cities. To download data from the website, Uber requires you to provide your name, email address, and purpose. But they also provide a [command-line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/movement-data-toolkit) that lets you download street-speed data without any registration. [h/t Michael A. Rice]


__London bike infrastructure.__ Transport for London [has launched](https://tfl-newsroom.prgloo.com/news/tfl-press-release-worlds-largest-cycling-database-set-to-make-cycling-in-the-capital-easier) its Cycling Infrastructure Database, which “contains the location of more than 240,000 pieces of cycling infrastructure in London, including places to park and the location of cycle lanes.” The new information can be found among the agency’s [broader collection of cycling data](https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/); look for the “CyclingInfrastructure” folder.

__Deaths on the job.__ Since 1992, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ has collected data on work-related deaths through its [Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfoi1.htm). The results are presented as various cross-tabulations — by industry, demographic, circumstances, and more. __Related:__ The agency also publishes [data on non-fatal injuries and illnesses](https://www.bls.gov/iif/soii-data.htm). [h/t [Elissa Philip Gentry and W. Kip Viscusi](https://academic.oup.com/aler/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/aler/ahz007/5531642)]


__Bug fixes.__ Researchers at Brazil’s Federal University of Ceará [have published](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3345639) a [new dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/Replication_Package_-_PROMISE_19/8852084) “composed of more than 70,000 bug-fix reports from 10 years of bug-fixing activity of 55 projects from the Apache Software Foundation.”
