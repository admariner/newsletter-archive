*Bike and pedestrian safety, computer vulnerabilities, sunniness, German political speeches, and boy bands.*


__Bike and pedestrian safety.__ A growing number of cities publish detailed data on bicyclist and pedestrian injuries involving cars, including [New York City](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/vz_datafeeds.shtml), [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if), [Boston](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/vision-zero-crash-records), [Seattle](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Collisions/vac5-r8kk), [St. Paul, Minn.](https://information.stpaul.gov/Public-Safety/Pedestrian-And-Bike-Crash-Data-Dataset/bw92-5h94), [Chapel Hill, N.C.](https://www.chapelhillopendata.org/explore/?sort=modified&q=crashes), [Tempe, Ariz.](https://data.tempe.gov/dataset/high-severity-traffic-crashes-1-08), [Toronto](http://opendata-torontops.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/55d5b9f7af7d4710bc98743b2c005f02_0), and [London](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/road-safety) — many through the cities’ “[Vision Zero](https://visionzeronetwork.org/resources/vision-zero-cities/)” street-safety initiatives. (Some of the datasets also include car-on-car collisions.) __Related:__ “[The most dangerous intersections in Seattle for bicyclists and pedestrians](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/the-most-dangerous-intersections-in-seattle-for-bicyclists-and-pedestrians/).” [h/t [Rachel Schallom](http://www.rachelschallom.com/) + [Jeff Asher](https://twitter.com/Crimealytics/status/862709032515194880)]


__Computer vulnerabilities.__ [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) is a [downloadable](https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/index.html) list of more than 110,000 “publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.” Each vulnerability is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., [CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160)) and given a description. The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) takes the list and [adds more information](https://cve.mitre.org/about/cve_and_nvd_relationship.html) for each entry, “such as fix information, severity scores, and impact ratings.” That database is available in a variety of [bulk downloads and data feeds](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds); you can also [search it online](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search).

__Sunniness.__ The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s [solar datasets](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/data-solar.html) measure the average annual and monthly “total solar resource” for the United States, broken down by state, county, ZIP code, and roughly-10-square-kilometer chunks of the country. __Bonus:__ More sun-radiation datasets [via this Stack Overflow answer](https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/1064/api-for-sun-radiation-illuminance-data/1065#1065).

__German political speeches.__ Academic researcher [Adrien Barbaresi](http://adrien.barbaresi.eu/) has compiled a corpus of [thousands of speeches](http://adrien.barbaresi.eu/corpora/speeches/) from the the German Presidency, Presidency of the Bundestag, Chancellery, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The corpus, now in its third version, was first released in 2011. [h/t [Adrien Barbaresi](https://github.com/awesomedata/apd-core/blob/4955130a8898b4d5ace0e699bc1506b3be75b659/core/NaturalLanguage/German-Political-Speeches-Corpus.yml)]


__Boy bands.__ The Pudding’s [Internet Boy Band Database](https://pudding.cool/2018/11/boy-bands/) is “an audio-visual history of every boy band to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 since 1980.” You can [download the underlying data](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/boybands), which is stored in two files: *boys.csv* and *bands.csv*.
