Data Is Plural — 2018.10.03 edition
===================================

*Critical habitats, European polling, car traffic, bike traffic, and billboards in Florida.*


__Critical habitats.__ The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service publishes a database outlining the [critical habitats for more than 700 threatened and endangered species](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/report/table/critical-habitat.html). For each habitat, the dataset provides its geographic boundary lines, the species’ name and type, the size of the habitat, the date it was declared critical, and more. __Related:__ [Other geospatial datasets from the USFWS](https://www.fws.gov/gis/data/national/), including those on the [Coastal Barrier Resources System](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/boundaries-of-the-john-h-chafee-coastal-barrier-resources-system) and [migratory bird populations](https://migbirdapps.fws.gov/).


__European electoral polling.__ [PollOfPolls.eu](https://pollofpolls.eu/) aggregates political polls from 30 European countries. The Vienna-based initiative has, for instance, collected and standardized more than 1,000 individual polls on British parliament since 2014, and 60 on the Bavarian state elections. You can download each set of standardized data as either JSON or CSV. [h/t [Jovi Juan](https://twitter.com/DaoOfJ)]


__Car traffic.__ The [UK Department for Transport’s traffic counts](https://www.dft.gov.uk/traffic-counts/index.php) calculate the average daily number of vehicles “for every junction-to-junction link on the 'A' road and motorway network in Great Britain.” Likewise, California publishes the [average daily traffic, peak hourly traffic, truck traffic, and ramp traffic](http://www.dot.ca.gov/trafficops/census/) for each of its state highways. __Previously:__ U.S. [interstate highway traffic](http://metrocosm.com/map-us-traffic/) (DIP [2016.10.05](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-10-05-edition)) and [public roads](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms/fieldmanual/page01.cfm) ([DIP 2018.04.25](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-04-25-edition)) [h/t [Dave Fisher-Hickey](https://www.kaggle.com/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales) + [u/ron\_leflore](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/9j4y09/can_anyone_provide_me_with_real_time_traffic_data/e6orv72/)]


__Bike traffic.__ A slew of cities have installed devices to count bicycles that pass through major routes. At least several publish hourly or daily tallies: [London](http://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/), [Ottawa](http://data.ottawa.ca/dataset/bicycle-trip-counters-automated), [Edinburgh](https://data.edinburghopendata.info/dataset/bike-counter-data-set-cluster), [Seattle](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bike-program/bike-counters), [Cambridge, Mass.](https://data.cambridgema.gov/dataset/Eco-Totem-Broadway-Bicycle-Count/q8v9-mcfg), and [the Washington, DC area](http://counters.bikearlington.com/). New York City provides [daily counter-tallies for its East River bridges, but currently only as PDFs](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/bike-counts.shtml). __Related:__ ["[Transport for London]’s cycle counter data: initial thoughts"](https://lastnotlost.wordpress.com/2018/09/12/counterdata/) and “[What we can learn from Seattle’s bike-counter data](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/what-we-can-learn-from-seattles-bike-counter-data/).” [h/t [Giuseppe Sollazzo](https://us5.campaign-archive.com/?u=77ecabbd32e97a6caa9d7d40b&id=e072aa9980)]


__Florida’s billboards.__ The Florida Department of Transportation publishes its [inventory of active permits](http://fdotewp1.dot.state.fl.us/rightofway/DownloadData.aspx) for billboards and other “outdoor advertising.” For each permit, the dataset provides details about the permit-holder and the structure itself — such as its location, height, whether it’s in a city, and more.
