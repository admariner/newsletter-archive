*Presidential pardons, radioactive waste, songs of the world, semiconductor logistics, and ‚Äúevery Star Trek ever.‚Äù*

*üëã Do you want to know more about what fellow DIP subscribers are doing? Do you want to announce DIP-related projects to others? Do you dislike these ideas? I‚Äôve created a [short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemUwOBIccDOvJEhZx57laugJfL71fllf1__mLC91g2ScfPpg/viewform) and would be grateful if you could [fill it out](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemUwOBIccDOvJEhZx57laugJfL71fllf1__mLC91g2ScfPpg/viewform), regardless of your level of interest. Many thanks.*


__Presidential pardons.__ The US Department of Justice‚Äôs [Office of the Pardon Attorney](https://www.justice.gov/pardon) reviews all federal clemency requests and advises the president on such matters. The office provides a [search tool and spreadsheet](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/search-clemency-case-status-since-1989) with the names, case statuses, and decision dates for all 76,000+ pardon and commutation requests since 1989. It also publishes a [series of tables](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemency-recipients), with varying structure, listing the people who received clemency from each president since Richard Nixon. Those tables additionally include recipients who did not submit formal requests and, for more recent presidents, details about the recipients‚Äô offenses and sentences. [Another page](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemency-statistics) contains clemency statistics for each year and president since William McKinley.


__Radioactive waste.__ Through its [Nuclear Fuel Data Survey](https://www.eia.gov/Survey/#gc-859), the US Energy Information Administration ‚Äúcollects data on spent nuclear fuel from all utilities that operate commercial nuclear reactors and from all others that possess irradiated fuel from commercial nuclear reactors.‚Äù The agency‚Äôs [latest release](https://www.eia.gov/nuclear/spent_fuel/), [published last year](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47796) with data through 2017, includes several basic tables. One tallies the [annual amount of nuclear fuel discharged and stored at commercial sites](https://www.eia.gov/nuclear/spent_fuel/ussnftab3.php) since 1968, measured by [assembly](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/fuel-assembly-fuel-bundle-fuel-element.html) count and metric tons of uranium. __As seen in__: ‚Äú[As nuclear waste piles up, scientists seek the best long-term storage solutions](https://cen.acs.org/environment/pollution/nuclear-waste-pilesscientists-seek-best/98/i12)‚Äù (Chemical & Engineering News, 2020).


__Songs of the world.__ In a [paper published this month](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275469), researchers describe [the Global Jukebox](https://theglobaljukebox.org/) ‚Äî an interactive map and [compilation of datasets](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275469#pone-0275469-t001) focused on traditional songs from around the world. The project traces its history back to initial prototypes in the 1980s by [Alan Lomax](https://www.culturalequity.org/alan-lomax/about-alan), a musicologist who collected many of the recordings. The [core dataset](https://github.com/theglobaljukebox/cantometrics), called Cantometrics, encodes ‚Äú37 aspects of musical style for 5,776 traditional songs from 1,026 societies.‚Äù Others [include](https://github.com/theglobaljukebox), for example, datasets of [song instruments](https://github.com/theglobaljukebox/instruments) and [phrasing patterns](https://github.com/theglobaljukebox/minutage).

__Semiconductor logistics.__ The [Emerging Technology Observatory](https://eto.tech/), a [new initiative](https://eto.tech/blog/introducing-emerging-technology-observatory/) based at Georgetown University, aims to provide a ‚Äúpublic platform for high-quality, actionable data resources on the global emerging technology landscape.‚Äù Its [Advanced Semiconductor Supply Chain Dataset](https://eto.tech/dataset-docs/chipexplorer/), which you can [download](https://github.com/georgetown-cset/eto-supply-chain/tree/main/data) and [explore online](https://chipexplorer.eto.tech/), contains ‚Äúmanually compiled, high-level information about the tools, materials, processes, countries, and firms involved in the production of advanced logic chips.‚Äù [h/t [Zach Arnold](https://cset.georgetown.edu/staff/zachary-arnold/)]


__‚ÄúEvery Star Trek ever.‚Äù__ [The dataset](https://www.airtable.com/universe/expsZ6vRPGwedtNfq/every-star-trek-book-ever?explore=true): [Flourish Klink](https://www.flourishklink.com/)‚Äôs [compilation](https://www.airtable.com/universe/expsZ6vRPGwedtNfq/every-star-trek-book-ever) of every official Star Trek book, audiobook, comic, episode, movie, and more. ‚ÄúMy continuing mission: To consume every piece of *Star Trek* content ever made!‚Äù __Previously__: [Star Trek computer-talk](https://www.speechinteraction.org/TNG/index.html) ([DIP 2022.08.10](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-08-10-edition/)) and [a Star Trek API](http://stapi.co/) ([DIP 2018.11.07](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-11-07-edition/)).
