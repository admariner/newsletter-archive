Data Is Plural — 2021.09.08 edition
===================================

*OpenSanctions, alternative fueling, India’s political parties, software licenses, and UK parliamentary ejections.*


__Persons of interest.__ [OpenSanctions](https://opensanctions.org/), an [open-source project](https://github.com/pudo/opensanctions) that [launched its website last week](https://twitter.com/open_sanctions/status/1432977327282171904), is “an international database of persons and companies of political, criminal, or economic interest.” It combines and standardizes data from [20+ sources](https://opensanctions.org/datasets/), such as the US Treasury’s [sanctions](https://opensanctions.org/datasets/us_ofac_sdn/) [lists](https://opensanctions.org/datasets/us_ofac_cons/) ([DIP 2018.02.21](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-02-21-edition/)), [Interpol’s Red Notices](https://opensanctions.org/datasets/interpol_red_notices/), [members of EU parliament](https://opensanctions.org/datasets/eu_meps/), and the [CIA’s index of world leaders](https://opensanctions.org/datasets/us_cia_world_leaders/). The project uses a [detailed schema](https://opensanctions.org/reference/) to represent the particulars of each entity, including aliases, known cryptocurrency wallets, aircraft registrations, sanction dates, and more. You can [download the data](https://opensanctions.org/docs/usage/) with those detailed representations or in simpler formats.

__Alternative fueling.__ The US Bureau of Transportation Statistics’ [summer update](https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/national-transportation-atlas-database-summer-2021-adds-alternative-fuel-corridors-dataset) to its [National Transportation Atlas Database](https://www.bts.gov/ntad) adds a [dataset](https://data-usdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/alternative-fuel-corridors/explore) on “[alternative fuel corridors](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/alternative_fuel_corridors/)” — stretches of highway with a sufficient frequency of fueling stations. (Electric vehicle corridors must, for instance, have charging stations at least every 50 miles.) The release covers electric, hydrogen, propane, compressed natural gas, and liquefied natural gas infrastructure, and complements a prior dataset of [56,000+ such stations](https://data-usdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/alternative-fueling-stations-1/explore). __Related__: The Department of Energy’s maps and datasets of [alternative fueling stations](https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/) and [corridors](https://afdc.energy.gov/corridors). [h/t [Morgan Stevens](https://datainnovation.org/2021/08/tracking-alternative-fueling-facilities-across-the-united-states/)]


__India’s political parties.__ The [Trivedi Centre for Political Data](https://tcpd.ashoka.edu.in/) has published a [dataset](https://tcpd.ashoka.edu.in/political-parties-of-india/) of “all parties that have contested national and state elections in India since 1962,” with an eye toward unifying the information across name changes. For each legislative level and state, the dataset [indicates](https://github.com/tcpd/ppi/blob/main/17Aug2021TCPDPPI_1_0.pdf) each party’s first and last year contesting elections, number of seats won, number of female and [Scheduled Caste/Tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes) candidates fielded, and more. [h/t [Vijdan Mohammad Kawoosa](https://twitter.com/vijdankawoosa/status/1431642431590567944) + [Gilles Verniers](https://twitter.com/gilkumar/status/1431210872945328146)]


__Software licenses.__ The [ScanCode LicenseDB](https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/) provides information about 1,700+ software licenses, ranging from the common (e.g., [MIT License](https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/mit.html)) to the idiosyncratic ([SQLite Blessing](https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/blessing.html)) to the obscure ([Ubuntu Font License](https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/ubuntu-font-1.0.html)). The [records](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/tree/develop/src/licensedcode/data/licenses), which are part of a broader [license-detection toolkit](https://www.aboutcode.org/projects/scancode.html), list each license’s core phrasing, general category, custodian, relevant URLs, and [other details](https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/help.html).

__UK parliamentary ejections.__ A UK House of Commons Library [research briefing](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn02430/) in July included a spreadsheet of “MPs who have left the Chamber voluntarily, been asked to withdraw, or who have been suspended,” along with the date, reason, and suspension period. [Another briefing](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn03169/), published the same day, “attempts to capture all instances where an apology has been made on the floor of the House of Commons since 1979.” [h/t [Andi Fugard](https://twitter.com/InductiveStep/status/1419001122799423490)]
