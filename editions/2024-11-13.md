More globally, the World Trade Organization provides [tools to query and download data about its members‚Äô tariffs](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tariffs_e/tariff_data_e.htm), as well as databases of [regional trade agreements](https://rtais.wto.org/UI/PublicMaintainRTAHome.aspx) and [preferential trade agreements](https://ptadb.wto.org/). __Previously__: [Trade policy intervention data](https://www.globaltradealert.org/data_extraction) from [Global Trade Alert](https://www.globaltradealert.org/) ([DIP 2022.01.19](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-01-19-edition/)).
