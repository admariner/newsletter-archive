__Nuclear weapon systems.__ The [Council on Strategic Risks](https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/about/mission-and-vision/)‚Äôs [Nuclear Weapon Systems Project](https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/nolan/nuclear-systems-project/) aims ‚Äúto document every type of nuclear weapon system ever deployed‚Äù by China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US ‚Äî the five ‚Äúnuclear weapon states‚Äù per the [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons). The project‚Äôs [core dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oaRJKHwF9p48tPGHBJw5tB13YgsllLm4MAHOpT6tSpg/edit#gid=804863401), [launched last week](https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/2023/11/29/introducing-the-nuclear-weapon-systems-project/), currently covers 250+ such systems. For each, it provides the system‚Äôs name, country, type (gravity bomb, torpedo, ICBM, etc.), military branches in charge of deployment, ‚Äúmission‚Äù (tactical, strategic, or hybrid), years introduced and retired, replacement system, and more. __Previously__: [Nuclear stockpiles](https://fas.org/initiative/status-world-nuclear-forces/) ([DIP 2022.11.02](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-11-02-edition/)), [nuclear explosions](https://github.com/data-is-plural/nuclear-explosions) ([DIP 2016.03.23](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-03-23-edition/)), and [uranium/plutonium facilities](http://www.matthewfuhrmann.com/datasets.html) ([DIP 2016.02.24](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-02-24-edition/)).


__Social media platform policies.__ The [Platform Governance Archive](https://www.platformgovernancearchive.org/) ‚Äúcollects and curates policies of major social media platforms in a long-term perspective.‚Äù The [initial version of the archive](https://www.platformgovernancearchive.org/data/dataset-pga-v1-historical-dataset/) used the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) retrospectively to collect policies published 2005‚Äì2021 by Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube. The [new version](https://www.platformgovernancearchive.org/data/dataset-pga-v2-ongoing-collection/), [part of a re-launch this year](https://www.platformgovernancearchive.org/2023/re-launch-of-platform-governance-archive-pga-with-new-dataset-access-options-website-and-data-paper/), uses web-scraping [to track 18 platforms‚Äô policies daily](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions). __Related__: The new version is a collaboration with the [Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org/), an evolution of [work](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/en/our-work) by France‚Äôs Ambassador for Digital Affairs to track terms of service, featured in [DIP 2021.01.20](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-01-20-edition/).


__EU court cases.__ The [IUROPA Project](https://www.iuropa.pol.gu.se/about)‚Äôs [CJEU Database](https://www.iuropa.pol.gu.se/cjeu-database) ‚Äúis the most complete collection of research-ready data about the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and European Union (EU) law.‚Äù Developed from several official sources by [Stein Arne Brekke et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-and-courts/article/cjeu-database-platform-decisions-and-decisionmakers/69151433D88FD163B9CC997296CEE540), the [database provides tables](https://www.iuropa.pol.gu.se/cjeu-database/cjeu-database-platform) of all cases (45,000+), parties (85,000+), proceedings (47,000+), decisions (50,000+), citations (1,000,000+), judges (270+), and more from the court‚Äôs inception in 1952 through 2022. That first table, for instance, lists each case‚Äôs name, ID, sub-court, year, judgment status, appeal status, and additional details.

__The Fed‚Äôs ‚Äúdot plots.‚Äù__ [Four times a year](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) publishes its ‚ÄúSummary of Economic Projections‚Äù reports. Those reports contain a chart that‚Äôs come to be known as the Fed‚Äôs ‚Äú[dot plot](https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-the-fed-dot-plot),‚Äù which tallies the committee members‚Äô forecasts of the year-end [federal funds interest rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate) for this and subsequent years. Upon [noticing](https://mastodon.palewi.re/@palewire/111099055527649500) ‚Äúno simple, easy-to-access data file‚Äù of the chart‚Äôs information, journalist [Ben Welsh](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/) wrote [a scraper](https://github.com/palewire/fed-dot-plot-scraper) to create [such a file](https://github.com/palewire/fed-dot-plot-scraper/blob/main/data/dotplot.csv), currently covering 2018‚Äìpresent. __Previously__: [Federal Reserve communications](https://github.com/gtfintechlab/fomc-hawkish-dovish) collected by [Agam Shah et al.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4447632) ([DIP 2023.08.09](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-08-09-edition/)).


__Many coin flips.__ ‚ÄúMany people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process,‚Äù write [Franti≈°ek Barto≈° et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04153), introducing an experiment in which ‚Äúa group of 48 people (i.e., all but three of the co-authors) tossed coins of 46 different currencies √ó denominations and obtained a total number of 350,757 coin flips.‚Äù The authors have [published](https://osf.io/pxu6r/) the raw results, images of each coin, and videos of the flips.
