Data Is Plural — 2015.12.30 edition
===================================

*Slave sales, drug prices, home loans, satellites, and nine lonely answering machines.*


__New Orleans slave sales, 1856–1861.__ A [new study in the American Economic Review](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.20131483) suggests that slaveholders in the South underestimated the odds of “emancipation without compensation.” To reach its conclusions, researchers compiled a dataset of 15,377 slave sales, culled from remarkably detailed official records. Data for each sale includes demographic information about the slaves, seller, and buyer; the price paid; payment method; and researcher notes.


__Medicare’s priciest drugs.__ Last week, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services published a [new drug-spending dataset](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Information-on-Prescription-Drugs/). It focuses on medications that (a) cost the most, overall; (b) cost the most per patient; or (c) saw the largest price-hike between 2013 and 2014. Vimovo, an arthritis pain reliever, tops the price-hike rankings: Between 2013 and 2014, the average cost per unit increased more than sixfold, from $1.94 to $12.46.

__Millions of home loans.__ Over the weekend, the *Seattle Times* and BuzzFeed News published an [investigation into Clayton Homes](http://www.buzzfeed.com/danielwagner/warren-buffetts-predatory-lender-charges-minorities-a-lot-mo), a company that is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and that “has grown to dominate virtually every aspect of America’s mobile-home industry.” The investigation draws on data released through the [Home Mortgage Disclosure Act](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda/learn-more). The law requires large lenders to publish details about each of their loans. You can download [the raw data from the FFIEC](https://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/hmdaflat.htm), or [slightly user-friendlier versions from the CFPB](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda/explore).

__Every known satellite orbiting Earth.__ The [Union of Concerned Scientists’s Satellite Database](http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/space-weapons/satellite-database.html) currently contains 1,305 entries and is updated “roughly quarterly.” The longest-orbiting: [AMSAT-OSCAR 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSAT-OSCAR_7), an amateur radio satellite launched in November 1974. __Related:__ [The satellites, visualized](http://qz.com/296941/interactive-graphic-every-active-satellite-orbiting-earth/).

__Things lost (and not yet found) on the New York subway.__ Among them: [37,622 cellphones; 3,604 hats; 1,903 scarves; 1,017 birth certificates; 483 diaries; 115 VHS tapes; 82 violins; 41 GPS navigation systems; and 9 answering machines](http://advisory.mtanyct.info/LPUWebServices/CurrentLostProperty.aspx). At least one of the 2,756 umbrellas is mine.

*Correction to last week’s Census of Agriculture item, which incorrectly cited Oregon’s 2007 numbers: In 2012, Oregon harvested 6.4 million trees, or 37% of the census total. [h/t [Joe Murphy](https://twitter.com/joemurph)]*
