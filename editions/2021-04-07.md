Data Is Plural — 2021.04.07 edition
===================================

*Post offices, Han Chinese names, working hours, London’s COVID restrictions, and 1½ centuries of Great Lakes fishing.*


__Post offices.__ Historian [Cameron Blevins](https://www.cameronblevins.org/) has released a [dataset](https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/) of 166,000+ post offices operating in the US between 1639 and 2000. It includes their years of service and precise/approximate geocoordinates, “making it one of the most fine-grained and expansive datasets currently available for studying the historical geography of the United States.” The project [builds on research by the late Richard W. Helbock](https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/data-biography/) and provides the data-foundation for Blevins’s new book, [*Paper Trails: The US Post and the Making of the American West*](https://www.cameronblevins.org/paper-trails/), and [companion website](https://gossamernetwork.com/). __Read more__: [Blevins’s introductory Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/historying/status/1377336343676608513).

__Han Chinese names.__ The [Chinese Name Database](https://github.com/psychbruce/ChineseNames), published by social psychology grad student [Han-Wu-Shuang (Bruce) Bao (包寒吴霜)](https://psychbruce.github.io/), “contains nationwide frequency statistics of 1,806 Chinese surnames and 2,614 Chinese characters used in given names, covering about 1.2 billion Han Chinese population (96.8% of the Han Chinese household-registered population born from 1930 to 2008 and still alive in 2008).” The statistics, obtained from China’s National Citizen Identity Information Center, also record the frequencies of given-name characters for six age cohorts, based on decade of birth. __Read more__: “[What can we tell from the evolution of Han Chinese names?](https://kontinentalist.com/stories/a-cultural-history-of-han-chinese-names-for-girls-and-boys-in-china)” — an explainer and analysis by [Isabella Chua](https://twitter.com/patcheez94) in [Kontinentalist](https://kontinentalist.com/about).

__Working hours.__ For an article initially published in 2013 and since updated, Our World in Data has examined [historical trends in the number of hours that people work](https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours). The [data sources](https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours#data-sources) vary in geographic and temporal scope, with most spanning decades; they include [Huberman and Minns](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/minns/Huberman_Minns_EEH_2007.pdf) (PDF, see Table 3), the [Penn World Table](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/), the [Total Economy Database](https://conference-board.org/data/economydatabase) (registration required), the [OECD](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS), and more. 


__London’s COVID restrictions.__ London [is providing](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/covid-19-restrictions-timeseries) an “experimental dataset” categorizing the various coronavirus-related restrictions that have affected the UK capital since March 2020. It lists the dates of 22 policy changes, including three separate lockdowns; whether schools, pubs, restaurants, and/or shops were closed; whether household mixing was banned; and more.

__Fishing the Great Lakes.__ The Great Lakes Fishery Commission, [whose founding was spurred by an invasion of sea lampreys](http://www.glfc.org/about.php), publishes [several datasets](http://www.glfc.org/great-lakes-databases.php) relevant to the famous North American basin. Among them: “Commercial Fish Production In The Great Lakes 1867-2015,” which tallies the number of pounds caught each year by lake, jurisdiction, and species.
