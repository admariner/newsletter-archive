*Banned and challenged books, mass expulsions, European air traffic, Shakespeare, and Saturday Night Live.*


__Banned and challenged books.__ A [recent](https://pen.org/press-release/report-1586-school-book-bans-and-restrictions-in-86-school-districts-across-26-states/) [report](https://pen.org/banned-in-the-usa/) from [PEN America](https://pen.org/about-us/) identified 1,500+ decisions, made between July 2021 and March 2022, to ban books from classrooms and school libraries. A [spreadsheet accompanying the report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTs_PB7KuTMBtNMESFEGuK-0abzhNxVv4tgpI5-iKe8/edit#gid=1623346099) lists each decision’s date, type, state, and school district, as well as each banned book’s title, authors, illustrators, and translators. __Related__: Independent researcher [Tasslyn Magnusson](https://twitter.com/TasslynM), in [partnership](https://www.everylibraryinstitute.org/book_censorship_database_magnusson) with [EveryLibrary](https://www.everylibrary.org/about-everylibrary), maintains a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LqhGcvFDdT4izvoXRrz95BTDUzLr7M3IHf-2HGKhX7I/edit#gid=1604785798) of both book bans and book challenges, with 3,000+ entries since the 2021–22 school year.

__Mass expulsions.__ Political scientist [Meghan M. Garrity](https://www.meghanmgarrity.com/)’s [Government-Sponsored Mass Expulsion dataset](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00223433211068633) focuses on “policies in which governments systematically remove ethnic, racial, religious or national groups, en masse.” Using a combination of archival research and secondary sources, Garrity documents 139 such events, estimated to have expelled more than 30 million people between 1900 and 2020. For each expulsion, the dataset provides “information on the expelling country, onset, duration, region, scale, category of persons expelled, and frequency.” To download it, visit the Journal of Peace Research’s [replication data portal](https://www.prio.org/journals/jpr/replicationdata) and search for “mass expulsion.”


__European air traffic.__ [Eurocontrol](https://www.eurocontrol.int/about-us), the main organization coordinating Europe’s air traffic management, publishes an “[aviation intelligence portal](https://ansperformance.eu/)” with a range of industry metrics, including [traffic reports](https://ansperformance.eu/traffic/) that count the daily number of flights [by country](https://www.eurocontrol.int/Economics/DailyTrafficVariation-States.html), [by airport](https://www.eurocontrol.int/Economics/DailyTrafficVariation-Airports.html), and [by operator](https://www.eurocontrol.int/Economics/DailyTrafficVariation-AOs.html). The portal also offers [bulk datasets](https://ansperformance.eu/data/) on topics such as [airport traffic](https://ansperformance.eu/reference/dataset/airport-traffic/), [flight efficiency](https://ansperformance.eu/reference/dataset/horizontal-flight-efficiency/), [estimated CO2 emissions](https://ansperformance.eu/reference/dataset/emissions/), and more.

__Shakespeare.__ [The Folger Shakespeare](https://shakespeare.folger.edu/about-the-folger-shakespeare/) “brings you the complete works of the world’s greatest playwright, edited for modern readers.” Its digital editions of the Bard’s plays and poems are available [to read online](https://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/) and [to download](https://shakespeare.folger.edu/download/) in various file formats. It also [provides an API](https://shakespeare.folger.edu/the-folger-shakespeare-api/), with [endpoints](https://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/api) for synopses, roles, monologues, word frequencies, and more.

__Saturday Night Live.__ [Joel Navaroli](https://twitter.com/snlmedia)’s [snlarchives.net](http://www.snlarchives.net/) aims to catalog and cross-reference every episode, cast member, host, character, sketch, impression, and other aspects of Saturday Night Live’s 47-and-counting seasons. An [open-source project](https://github.com/hhllcks/snldb) by [Hendrik Hilleckes](https://www.hhllcks.de/) and [Colin Morris](https://colinmorris.github.io/) scrapes much of that information into [structured data files](https://github.com/hhllcks/snldb/tree/master/output). __As seen in__: [Morris’s 2017 analysis of gender representation in SNL sketches](https://colinmorris.github.io/blog/snl-sketch-gender).
