Data Is Plural — 2017.06.28 edition
===================================

*Infectious diseases, people’s genes, real estate inventories, tax-exempt nonprofits, and politicians’ tweets.*

&nbsp;

**Infectious diseases in Europe.** The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control’s [Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases](http://atlas.ecdc.europa.eu/public/index.aspx?Instance=GeneralAtlas) lets you browse, map, and download data on the historical incidence of several dozen diseases — from anthrax to Zika — in each of the European Economic Area’s countries. **Related:** [Keila Guimarães’s recent investigation into penicillin shortages](https://qz.com/984705/syphilis-is-on-the-rise-because-penicillin-isnt-profitable/), which uses the Centre’s data on syphilis cases.

&nbsp;

**People’s genes.** [OpenSNP](https://opensnp.org/) is a website that lets people publish the results of their genetic tests (such as those sold by 23andMe, deCODEme, FamilyTreeDNA), “find others with similar genetic variations, [get] the latest primary literature on their variations, and help scientists find new associations.” Since 2012, users have uploaded [more than 3,000 sets of genetic variants](https://opensnp.org/statistics), which you can [download individually or in bulk](https://opensnp.org/genotypes) or access via [OpenSNP’s API](https://github.com/openSNP/snpr/wiki/JSON-API). Users can also list [various personal traits](https://opensnp.org/phenotypes), such as eye color, height, coffee consumption, and lactose intolerance. **Useful primer:** SNP stands for “single nucleotide polymorphism,” [the NIH explains](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/snp). They’re “the most common type of genetic variation”; each one “represents a difference in a single DNA building block, called a nucleotide.”

&nbsp;

**Real estate inventories.** The National Association of Realtors publishes [monthly real estate inventory data](http://research.realtor.com/data/inventory-trends/) “at the national level, the 500 largest metropolitan areas, the 1,000 largest counties, and over 15,000 zip codes.” The data, based on the realtors’ [multiple listing services](http://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/what-is-the-mls-multiple-listing-service/), goes back five years and “tracks key market metrics including list prices, days on market, and total active inventory.” As of early June, six counties — Manhattan, plus five in California — had median listing prices above $1 million. **Previously:** [The Census Bureau’s Annual Characteristics of New Housing](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-06-22-edition) (DIP 2016.06.22), [international house prices](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-02-08-edition) (DIP 2017.02.08), [millions of mortgages](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2015-12-30-edition) (DIP 2015.12.30), and [millions more mortgages](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-03-15-edition) (DIP 2017.03.15).

&nbsp;

**Every federally tax-exempt nonprofit.** The Internal Revenue Service publishes a file listing all “organizations eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions” — currently more than 1 million [charities, private foundations, and other groups](https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/forwardToDeductStatusSearchHelp.do). (Not all nonprofits apply for, or receive, tax-exempt status from the IRS; but all tax-exempt organizations are nonprofits.) **Previously:** [Annual IRS 990 filings, in bulk](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-06-22-edition) (DIP 2016.06.22). [h/t [Norbert Krupa + Derek Willis](https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/16/is-there-a-complete-list-of-all-us-tax-exempt-nonprofits-in-machine-readable-for)]

&nbsp;

**140-character politics.** The recently-launched [Tweets Of Congress](https://alexlitel.github.io/congresstweets/) is collecting and publishing daily archives of tweets by congressional representatives, caucuses, and committees. Meanwhile, the [Trump Twitter Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/about) has collected more than 30,000 of @realDonaldTrump’s tweets, which you can [search](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive) and [download](https://github.com/bpb27/trump_tweet_data_archive).
