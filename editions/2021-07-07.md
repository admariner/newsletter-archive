===================================

*Water politics, government regulations, rural hospital closures, vertebrates’ viruses, and Andean roadkill.*


__Water politics.__ Oregon State University’s [International Water Events Database](https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/content/international-water-event-database) summarizes 7,000+ episodes from 1948 to 2008 that “concern water as a scarce or consumable resource or as a quantity to be managed,” categorizing their intensities and indicating the basins and countries involved. The [Pacific Institute](https://pacinst.org/)’s [Water Conflict Chronology](https://www.worldwater.org/water-conflict/) documents 926 events (including a few legends) between 3000 BC and 2019 that involved violence or the threat of it. Bernhauer et al.’s [Water-Related Intrastate Conflict and Cooperation](https://www.prio.org/Publications/Publication/?x=5118) dataset details 10,000+ events in the Middle East, Mediterranean, and Sahel between 1997 and 2009. __Related__: Takeshi Wada’s “[Geographic Distribution of Water Conflicts Worldwide: A Comparative Analysis of Four Databases](https://ifi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sdgs_wp_2020_wada_en.pdf)” (*pdf*) discusses these resources plus [GDELT](https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html), a broader-scope event database.


__Government regulations.__ [QuantGov](https://www.quantgov.org/about), an [open-source](https://github.com/quantgov) project of the free-market-oriented [Mercatus Center](https://www.mercatus.org/), “solves the problem of quantifying large amounts of policy text for research and comprehension by using machine learning and natural language processing.” Its [RegData](https://www.quantgov.org/history) initiative applies this approach to government regulations over time — quantifying their length and linguistic complexity and trying to identify their relevant [NAICS](https://www.census.gov/naics/)-classified industries. Its [datasets](https://www.quantgov.org/download-data) examine rules enacted by the federal government and most US states, as well as federal and subnational regulations from Australia, Canada, and India.

__Rural hospital closures.__ The [North Carolina Rural Health Research Program](https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/) maintains a list of [rural hospital closures in the US since 2005](https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/). The dataset contains 181 entries through June 2021, each representing a complete closure or a conversion from inpatient care to other services, and indicates the hospital, number of beds, Medicare payment program, month of closure, and the location’s [Rural-Urban Commuting Area classification](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes.aspx).

__Vertebrates’ viruses.__ [VIRION](https://www.viralemergence.org/virion) is “an open atlas of the vertebrate virome” that [launched in May](https://twitter.com/viralemergence/status/1394270587267264518). It represents the associations between 9,000+ viruses and 3,700+ host species, [drawing from a range of sources](https://github.com/viralemergence/virion#how-we-built-virion), including USAID’s [PREDICT project](https://healthmap.org/predict/) and the [GloBI project](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/), which organizes data about inter-species interactions.

__Andean roadkill.__ For their recent paper, “[Geography of roadkills within the Tropical Andes Biodiversity Hotspot](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/btp.12938),” ecologists [Pablo Medrano-Vizcaíno](https://twitter.com/pmedranoviz) and [Santiago Espinosa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vv-viDsAAAAJ&hl=en) surveyed three 33-kilometer road segments dozens of times in 2014. Their [publication datasets](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.xwdbrv1cp) provide details about the 445 dead vertebrates they found, including one new-to-science species of snake.
