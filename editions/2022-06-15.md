*Consumer prices, incarceration and redistricting, drug combinations, airplane laser incidents, and European royal families.*


__Consumer prices.__ The US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ widely-cited [Consumer Price Index](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) measures “the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.” In addition to overall averages, the index provides [decades of detailed data](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm) on monthly price changes for [hundreds of sub-baskets](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/additional-resources/index-publication-level.htm), ranging from broad groupings (e.g., apparel, housing, education) to narrower categories (e.g., frozen vegetables, window coverings, veterinarian services).

__Incarceration and redistricting.__ The US Census counts prisoners as residing where they are incarcerated. In 2010, however, [New York passed a law](https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A9710-D.html) requiring the state to adjust these figures for redistricting purposes, reassigning people in state and federal prisons to their pre-incarceration addresses. Those adjusted counts, down to the Census block level, are available for [2010](https://latfor.state.ny.us/data/?sec=2010amendpop) and [2020](https://latfor.state.ny.us/data/?sec=2020amendpop). A [new report](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/ny/2020/report.html) from the [Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/about.html) and [VOCAL-NY](https://vocal-ny.org/about-us/) cross-references the 2020 data with the original Census numbers to determine [state prison incarceration rates](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/ny/2020/report.html#appendix) for each [county](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/ny/2020/county.html), [city](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/ny/2020/city.html), [ZIP code](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/ny/2020/zipcode.html), and other geographies. PPI says it [plans to issue similar reports](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/) for other states that have [enacted comparable reforms](https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/news/2021/10/26/state_count/).

__Drug combinations.__ [Guy Shtar et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01360-z)’s [Continuous Drug Combination Database](https://icc.ise.bgu.ac.il/medical_ai/CDCDB/) identifies 17,000+ unique medical drug combinations that have generated clinical interest, “curated automatically” from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) ([DIP 2018.05.09](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-05-09-edition/)), the FDA’s [Orange Book](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/approved-drug-products-therapeutic-equivalence-evaluations-orange-book) ([DIP 2017.03.08](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-03-08-edition/)), and international patent records. The automated approach allows the database to be “continuously updated,” with new versions published weekly.


__Airplane laser incidents.__ “Aiming a laser at an aircraft is a serious safety risk and violates federal law,” [according](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers) to the Federal Aviation Administration, which encourages flight staff and the public [to submit reports of such incidents](https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/safety/report/laserinfo/). The agency publishes [annual spreadsheets](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers/laws) of each reported incident since 2010, listing the date and time, flight number, aircraft model, altitude, local airport, laser color, and an injury indicator.


__European royal families.__ In “[A Network of Thrones](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20180521),” economists [Seth G. Benzell](https://www.sethgbenzell.com/) and [Kevin Cooke](http://kmcooke.weebly.com/) describe building a [dataset](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/117045/version/V2/view) that links “European royal kinship networks, monarchies, and wars to study the effect of family ties on conflict” between 1495 and 1918. The kinship records come from [Brian Tompsett](https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/brian-tompsett)’s [Directory of Royal Genealogical Data](http://web.archive.org/web/20120505084622/http://www3.dcs.hull.ac.uk/genealogy/royal/), which covers “almost every ruling house in the western world.” __Related__: [Andrej Kokkonen et al.](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/715065) have compiled a [dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/M2E5OI) of “royal offspring, siblings, and paternal uncles and aunts” for 27 European monarchies from 1000 to 1799. __Previously__: [European monarchs](https://thebackend.dev/monarchs/) ([DIP 2019.06.19](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-06-19-edition/)).
