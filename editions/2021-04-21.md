Data Is Plural — 2021.04.21 edition
===================================

*Domestic terrorism, web crawls, COVID-19 in incarceration facilities, New York City languages, and CEO dismissals.*


__Domestic terrorism.__ The [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/programs/about-us) has [analyzed](https://www.csis.org/analysis/military-police-and-rise-terrorism-united-states) data on 980 domestic terrorism plots and attacks in the US from 1994 through January 2021, categorizing them as “violent far-right,” “violent far-left,” “religious,” “ethnonationalist,” or “other.” (The [project’s methodology](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/210412_Jones_Methodology.pdf) provides further details.) The researchers haven’t published the full dataset, but have allowed the Washington Post to publish [a large slice of it](https://github.com/wpinvestigative/csis_domestic_terrorism) — a dozen columns for each incident, with dates, locations, type of target, and more. Based on its own research, the Post added eight more columns about the far-right attacks, which it used for a [data-driven article on the topic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/domestic-terrorism-data/). __Previously__: [The Global Terrorism Database](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/) ([DIP 2018.02.07](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-02-07-edition/)).


__The web, crawled.__ The nonprofit [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) is “dedicated to providing a copy of the internet to internet researchers, companies and individuals at no cost for the purpose of research and analysis.” Over the past decade, it has gathered and shared [petabytes of data](https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/) from its roughly-monthly web crawls. The [most recent](https://commoncrawl.org/2021/03/february-march-2021-crawl-archive-now-available/), completed in early March, contains 2.7 billion pages. __Related__: The University of Mannheim’s [Web Data Commons](http://webdatacommons.org/) generates structured data from the crawls, including [nearly 300 million rows](http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/schemaorgtables/) of information (on products, events, museums, and more) extracted from websites’ [schema.org](https://schema.org/) markup.

__COVID-19 in incarceration, by facility.__ For more than a year, the New York Times [collected data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/prisons) on "coronavirus infections, deaths and testing for state and federal prisons; immigration detention centers; juvenile detention facilities; local, regional and reservation jails; and those in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.” On Friday, it published the [case and death tolls for 2,000+ of these facilities](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/prisons/facilities.csv), as of March 2021. __Read more__: [The Times’ reporting and graphics based on the data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/10/us/covid-prison-outbreak.html). __Previously__: [Weekly COVID-19 numbers for each state prison system](https://github.com/themarshallproject/COVID_prison_data) ([DIP 2020.05.06](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-05-06-edition/)), collected by the Marshall Project and Associated Press.

__New York City languages.__ The [Endangered Language Alliance](https://elalliance.org/)’s [Languages of New York City map](https://languagemap.nyc/) highlights nearly 700 languages and dialects spoken in NYC and nearby counties. For each language, it indicates a number of significant sites where it is or has been spoken. The project’s [downloadable dataset](https://languagemap.nyc/Data) lists each site's status and neighborhood or city, plus the language’s linguistic family, countries of origin, and estimated number of global speakers.

__CEO dismissals.__ [Richard J. Gentry et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3278) have [overseen the collection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VtY-_7es3JE9ymnTNYUTp9nwJW4VPpduOY0L-z1Yh9s/edit) of [data on 1,400+ CEO dismissals](https://zenodo.org/record/4618103) and thousands of other CEO departures from S&P 1500 companies between 1992 and 2018. __Related__: [Claudio Fernandez-Araoz et al.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3824812) have compiled data on [CEO](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FG0FOE) and [CFO](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZC0AKE) turnover between 2014 and 2018.
