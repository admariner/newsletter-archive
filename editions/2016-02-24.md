Data Is Plural — 2016.02.24 edition
===================================

*The Supreme Court, armed conflict, nuclear capabilities, cruise ship inspections, and some laffs.*


__Supremely useful data.__ [The Supreme Court Database](http://supremecourtdatabase.org/index.php) is exactly what it sounds like — and definitively so. The [most recent release](http://supremecourtdatabase.org/data.php) covers all SCOTUS cases from 1946 through 2014. For each case, the database contains 247 “pieces of information,” including [the source of the case](http://supremecourtdatabase.org/documentation.php?var=caseSource), [why the court agreed to hear the case](http://supremecourtdatabase.org/documentation.php?var=jurisdiction), [the legal provisions at play](http://supremecourtdatabase.org/documentation.php?var=lawType), and [how each justice voted](http://supremecourtdatabase.org/documentation.php?var=vote).


__Armed conflict.__ The [Uppsala Conflict Data Program](http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/program_overview/) maintains [several large, interconnected datasets](http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/datasets/) describing decades of war, genocide, and other armed hostilities. Looking for a slightly less depressing experience? Try the UCDP’s dataset of [216 peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011](http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/datasets/ucdp_peace_agreement_dataset/).

__Nuclear capabilities.__ [The Nuclear Latency Dataset](http://www.matthewfuhrmann.com/datasets.html) contains “all known uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing facilities” built between 1939 and 2012. That amounts to 253 plants around the world, each with information on its construction timeframe, civilian-vs-military purpose, international oversight, and more.

__Cruise ship inspections.__ The CDC publishes a [searchable database of its cruise ship sanitation inspections](http://wwwn.cdc.gov/InspectionQueryTool/InspectionSearch.aspx) — but doesn’t provide an option to download the data. Last week, [an open-data enthusiast](https://github.com/marks) scraped the database and posted CSVs of [specific deficiencies and overall inspection scores since 1990](https://github.com/marks/cdc-cruise-ship-inspections). The lowest score: [The Nippon Maru’s 38 points (out of 100) in 1998](http://wwwn.cdc.gov/InspectionQueryTool/InspectionDetailReport.aspx?ColI=MTMzMDc2-8Ref6xawqHU%3d). __Related:__ [ProPublica’s “Cruise Control,” a searchable database of health and safety reports](https://projects.propublica.org/cruises/).

__Funny ha ha.__ Since 1999, [Jester](http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/) has been telling jokes. The website, built by UC Berkeley’s Laboratory for Automation Science and Engineering, asks you to rate its sometimes-humorous offerings, and then uses those answers to guess which of the remaining 100+ jokes you’ll like best. The UC Berkeley team behind the project has released [millions of joke ratings from more than 100,000 anonymous users](http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/).
