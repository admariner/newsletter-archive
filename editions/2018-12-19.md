Data Is Plural — 2018.12.19 edition
===================================

*Life expectancies, global debt, Philly property transactions, amounts of alcohol, and a lot of insect eggs.*

&nbsp;

**Life expectancy by Census tract.** The CDC’s [Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/usaleep/usaleep.html) calculates how long someone, born in a given Census tract in 2010–15, might expect to live. The estimates are based on a combination of death records, Census population data, and statistical modeling. **Related:** “[Map: What story does your neighborhood’s life expectancy tell?](https://qz.com/1462111/map-what-story-does-your-neighborhoods-life-expectancy-tell/)” (Quartz). **Previously:** Life expectancy [by income, gender, and city](https://healthinequality.org/) ([DIP 2016.04.13](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-02-08-edition)), and [by country](https://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/life_tables/situation_trends/en/) ([DIP 2017.02.08](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-02-08-edition)).

&nbsp;

**Global debt.** The International Monetary Fund’s [Global Debt Database](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/datasets/GDD) brings together “total gross debt” numbers for 190 countries, for the years 1950 to 2017. The database features a [detailed methodology](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2018/05/14/Global-Debt-Database-Methodology-and-Sources-45838) and includes indicators of government, household, and corporate debt.

&nbsp;

**Philly property transactions.** Philadelphia’s Department of Records has begun publishing a dataset of [all real estate transfers](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/real-estate-transfers) recorded since late 1999. The 3.7 million records include deeds, mortgages, condo declarations, and a few other types of documents. The deed data includes each property’s fair market value, address, grantor and grantee names, various taxes, and more. **Bonus:** [An interactive visualization of the data](https://data.phila.gov/visualizations/real-estate-transfers). **Previously:** [UK property sales](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/price-paid-data) ([DIP 2016.03.23](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-03-23-edition)).

**How much alcohol?** [Open Units](https://www.getthedata.com/open-units) is a dataset detailing the total amount of alcohol in 1,000+ beer and cider offerings, “based on information made public by drinks manufacturers, distributors and retailers.” For instance, a 355-mL bottle of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale contains 20 mL of alcohol, the same as a pint of Bud Light.

&nbsp;

**A lot of insect eggs.** A team of evolutionary biologists has compiled a dataset describing the [size and shape of eggs laid by more than 6,700 insect species](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/19/471953). You can [explore](https://shchurch.github.io/dataviz/index.html) and [download](https://github.com/shchurch/insect_egg_database_viz/tree/master/data) the underlying data, which is based on measurements from [1,756 published sources](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/suppl/2018/11/19/471953.DC1/471953-1.pdf).
