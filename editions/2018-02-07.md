===================================

*Hollywood's romantic age gaps, terrorism incidents, invasive species, Fed forecasts, and Donkey Kong.*


__Hollywood’s romantic age gaps.__ [Lynn Fisher](https://lynnandtonic.com/)’s [Hollywood Age Gap](https://hollywoodagegap.com/) collects data on silver screen love interests — more than 880 so far, from more than 630 movies — and then calculates the difference in those actors’ ages. The largest gap so far is the 52-year age difference in *Harold and Maude*. The movie with the most pairings is *Love Actually*, with seven. You can download the data as JSON and CSV files from [the project’s GitHub page](https://github.com/lynnandtonic/hollywood-age-gap).

__Terrorism incidents.__ [The Global Terrorism Database](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/), run by a University of Maryland–based consortium, is an “open-source database” of more than 170,000 terrorist events. The database, which currently covers 1970 through 2016, is [well-documented](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/using-gtd/) and includes information about about the attackers, locations, weapons, victims, and more. Note: To download the data, you first need to accept an end-user license agreement. __Previously:__ [Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-05-24-edition), from the same consortium (DIP 2017.05.24).

__Invasive species.__ [The Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species](http://www.griis.org/) combines data and observations from thousands of sources to create a standardized database of such species in more than 200 countries. can be explored by kingdom (plants, animals, fungi, etc.), ecosystem, and country. Each slice of data can be downloaded as a CSV. __Related:__ In a [*Scientific Data* paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017202) published last month, the researchers behind the effort described their methodology in detail.


__Federal Reserve forecasts.__ Before each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve’s research staff prepares a set of economic projections known as [the Greenbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenbook). Those forecasts are kept secret for five years, and then released to the public. The Philadelphia Fed’s [archive of public Greenbook data](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/greenbook-data/) dates back to 1966, and contains both PDFs and structured data files.


__Donkey Kong.__ [KongTrackr](http://kongtrackr.herokuapp.com) hosts detailed stats about specific games played on the beloved arcade fixture, with a focus on record-setting scores. The website’s database, which [can be downloaded as a single JSON file](http://kongtrackr.herokuapp.com/#/exportDatabase), currently includes 1,715 games by 450 players. __Related:__ [KongTrackr played a role in some recent high-score commotion](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/donkey-kong-scoreboard-strips-billy-mitchells-high-score-claims/). __Also related:__ KongTrackr says its site is “heavily influenced” by [this database of StarCraft 2 results](http://aligulac.com/).
