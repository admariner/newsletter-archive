*Missing migrants, global antitrust, microbes, geographic renaming proposals, and the life of a supercomputer.*


__Missing migrants.__ The [Missing Migrants Project](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/about) “tracks deaths of migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have gone missing along mixed migration routes worldwide.” Research for the project, an initiative of the [International Organization for Migration](https://www.iom.int), began after the [fatal Lampedusa shipwrecks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Lampedusa_migrant_shipwreck) of October 2013. For each incident, the project’s [datasets](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/downloads) specify the location, the number of people who died, the number who are missing, the number who survived, the sources of information, the source quality, and more. __Previously__: [European migration deaths](https://github.com/ondata/the-list), 1993 to May 2018 ([DIP 2018.07.18](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-07-18-edition)).

__Global antitrust.__ The [Comparative Competition Law project](https://comparativecompetitionlaw.org) classifies the legal provisions and enforcement of antitrust laws around the world, over time. The project is run by law professors [Anu Bradford](https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/anu-bradford) and [Adam Chilton](http://www.adamchilton.org), and features several [datasets and detailed codebooks](http://comparativecompetitionlaw.org/data/). (They require an email address but no formal registration.) __Related__: [Chilton’s introductory Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/adamschilton/status/1192498999204483074).

__Microorganisms.__ The [Microbe Directory](https://microbe.directory/) is an attempt to profile more than 7,000 bacteria, viruses, archaea, and other microorganisms. The directory [can be downloaded](https://microbe.directory/developers) [in bulk](https://github.com/microbe-directory/microbe-directory) and describes the microbes’ optimal temperature, optimal pH, Gram stain, pathogenicity, antimicrobial resistance, and more.


__Geographic (re)naming proposals.__ When someone wants to officially name or rename a geographic feature of the United States — such as a mountain, creek, or island — they file a proposal with the [US Board on Geographic Names](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/board-on-geographic-names). Those proposals end up on the agency’s “[Action List](https://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=geonames_web:review_lists:0:::::),” the most recent year of which can be downloaded as a spreadsheet. __Previously__: [The Board’s database of every US geographic name](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data) ([DIP 2015.10.21](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2015-10-21-edition)).

__The life of a supercomputer.__ [CIEMAT](http://fusionwiki.ciemat.es/wiki/CIEMAT) — a public institution in Spain that studies energy and the environment — [has published](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340919313629) nearly a decade of [processing receipts from its Euler supercomputer](https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/labs/parallel/workload/l_ciemat_euler/index.html). The records, which span the supercomputer’s entire lifetime, contain metadata for more than 9 million computing jobs, including timestamps, memory usage, and more.
