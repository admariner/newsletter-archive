*Redistricting, SARS-CoV-2 in local sewage, collective bargaining, European gas storage, and whaling.*


__Redistricting.__ US [decennial redistricting](https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting) is well underway, with redrawn legislative maps approved in the majority of states. [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/), [Politico](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2022/congressional-redistricting-maps-by-state-and-district/), and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/redistricting-tracker-map/) have all built graphics tracking the process and its likely effects on Congress. The [Redistricting Data Hub](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/), a project of the [Fair Representation in Redistricting Initiative](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/about/about-us/#whoweare), has been gathering states’ proposed and approved maps (e.g., [California’s](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/2021-california-congressional-districts-approved-plan/), from [its commission](https://www.wedrawthelinesca.org/final_maps)), as well [other datasets useful for analyzing the changes](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/data/about-our-data/). [All About Redistricting](https://redistricting.lls.edu/), a resource founded by Loyola Law School’s [Justin Levitt](https://redistricting.lls.edu/about/my-work/), also publishes [state mapping data](https://redistricting.lls.edu/mapdownload/?sortby=-updated&page=1), as well as a downloadable table describing [who controls each state’s redistricting process](https://redistricting.lls.edu/national-overview/?colorby=Institution&level=Congress&cycle=2020).


__SARS-CoV-2 in local sewage.__ [Biobot Analytics](https://biobot.io/), a wastewater epidemiology company, has been partnering with local governments to monitor sewage for traces of coronavirus. Their [public dashboard](https://biobot.io/data/) and [downloadable data](https://github.com/biobotanalytics/covid19-wastewater-data) provide weekly estimates of the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per milliliter of wastewater — at a national and regional level, and for 31 of the participating communities (some with data more recent than others). __Read more__: “[In Sewage, Clues to Omicron’s Surge](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/health/covid-omicron-wastewater-sewage.html)” (The New York Times).

__Collective bargaining.__ The US [Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Mediation_and_Conciliation_Service_\(United_States\))’s [stated mission](https://www.fmcs.gov/aboutus/) “is to preserve and promote labor-management peace and cooperation.” It also publishes [spreadsheets of data submitted](https://www.fmcs.gov/resources/documents-and-data/#tab-d3d7f5344cef9bab4d3) through its [Form F-7](https://www.fmcs.gov/resources/forms-applications/notice-of-bargaining-f-7/), which employers and unions must file when they can’t agree on modifying or ending a collectively bargained contract. The spreadsheets, which go back to 2015, list the employer and union’s name and location, their industry, the size of the bargaining unit, and a few other details. __Previously__: [Union elections](https://www.nlrb.gov/reports/graphs-data/recent-election-results) ([DIP 2021.05.05](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-05-05-edition/)) and [voluntary recognition](https://github.com/labordata/nlrb-voluntary-recognitions) ([DIP 2021.09.22](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-09-22-edition/)).

__European gas storage.__ The industry group [Gas Infrastructure Europe](https://www.gie.eu/) publishes [data on daily fuel storage levels at its members’ facilities](https://agsi.gie.eu/). For each facility, and aggregated to the provider and country level, the data [indicate](https://agsi.gie.eu/#/faq) the amount of fuel in storage, the percent capacity that represents, fuel added and withdrawn, and more. __As seen in__: “[Earlier Than Ever, European Gas Storage Is Half-Empty](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-13/gazprom-tweets-about-european-gas-shortages-it-may-be-creating)” (Bloomberg).

__Whaling.__ [WhalingHistory.org](https://whalinghistory.org/), a collaboration between the [Mystic Seaport Museum](https://mysticseaport.org/) and the [New Bedford Whaling Museum](https://whalingmuseum.org/), revolves around [a series of interconnected databases](https://whalinghistory.org/databases/). They include [every known American whaling voyage between the 1700s and 1920s](https://whalinghistory.org/av/voyages/), [entries from 1,381 of their logbooks](https://whalinghistory.org/av/logs/aowl/), and [some of their crew lists](https://whalinghistory.org/av/crew/), plus records from British and French voyages.
