Data Is Plural — 2020.03.18 edition
===================================

*Mostly coronavirus-related data, but also speed dating.*

&nbsp;

**COVID-19 testing in the US.** The [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) “collects information from 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and 5 other U.S. territories to provide the most comprehensive testing data we can collect for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.” The project — [a collaboration between *The Atlantic*, data scientist Jeff Hammerbacher, and a growing team of volunteers](https://covidtracking.com/about-team/) — “attempt[s] to include positive and negative results, pending tests, and total people tested for each state or district currently reporting that data.” (Unfortunately, not all states are reporting each of those numbers, and [private-lab testing also complicates the picture](https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking/status/1240017561757962245).) You can access the data [online](https://covidtracking.com/data/), [through an API](https://covidtracking.com/api/), [on GitHub](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data), and [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking). **Related**: [How to Understand Your State’s Coronavirus Numbers](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/03/how-understand-your-states-coronavirus-numbers/607921/) (*The Atlantic*, March 12).

**Coronavirus research papers.** The [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) is “a free resource of over 29,000 scholarly articles, including over 13,000 with full text, about COVID-19 and the coronavirus family of viruses for use by the global research community.” The dataset, produced by a collaboration of several research groups and the National Library of Medicine, “will be updated weekly." **Related**: On Monday, the White House [issued a “call to action to the tech community”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/call-action-tech-community-new-machine-readable-covid-19-dataset/) regarding the dataset, asking experts “to develop new text and data mining techniques that can help the science community answer high-priority scientific questions related to COVID-19.”

**WFH.** [Stayinghome.club](https://stayinghome.club/) is compiling hundreds of coronavirus-spurred [work-from-home policies](https://stayinghome.club/companies.html), [university annoucements](https://stayinghome.club/universities.html), and [event cancellation statuses](https://stayinghome.club/events.html). The project is [collaboratively edited on GitHub](https://github.com/phildini/stayinghomeclub), and includes instructions for how to add your company/university/event.

**Health security preparedness.** The [Global Health Security Index](https://www.ghsindex.org/about/) is “the first comprehensive assessment and benchmarking of health security and related capabilities across the 195 countries” that signed on to the WHO’s 2005 [International Health Regulations](https://www.who.int/ihr/legal_issues/states_parties/en/). The index is built on a “framework of 140 questions, organized across 6 categories, 34 indicators, and 85 subindicators to assess a country’s capability to prevent and mitigate epidemics and pandemics.” The first edition of the index [was released this past October](https://www.ghsindex.org/news/inaugural-global-health-security-index-finds-no-country-is-prepared-for-epidemics-or-pandemics/), and can be [downloaded as a macro-enabled Excel spreadsheet](https://www.ghsindex.org/report-model/). The [National Health Security Preparedness Index](https://nhspi.org/) aims to do something similar, but for US states; the [2019 results](https://nhspi.org/nations-ability-to-manage-health-emergencies-rises/) are also [available as a spreadsheet](https://nhspi.org/tools-resources/2019-release-health-security-data-explorer/nhspi_2019_data_download/).

**Speed dating.** Between 2002 and 2004, professors [Ray Fisman](https://twitter.com/RFisman) and [Sheena Iyengar](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/cbs-directory/detail/ss957) ran a series of speed dating events for Columbia University graduate students, while collecting detailed data on the participants and results. The full dataset is [available to download](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2008/01/21/the_speeddating_1/); data scientist [Keith McNulty](https://drkeithmcnulty.com/) has also [created a simplified version of it](https://drkeithmcnulty.com/2020/02/14/what-matters-in-speed-dating/).
