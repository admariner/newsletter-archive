Data Is Plural — 2018.02.28 edition
===================================

*Peace agreements, historical battles, American radiation, fellow mammals, and Rick and Morty.*


__Peace agreements.__ The [PA-X Peace Agreements Database](https://www.peaceagreements.org/) contains structured information about 1,500+ “formal, publicly-available documents” that address “conflict with a view to ending it.” The database covers more than 140 peace processes between 1990 and 2015, and each agreement has been [coded for more than 200 variables](https://www.peaceagreements.org/files/PA_X_codebook_Version1_Feb_20_20.pdf) — for instance, whether the agreement contains provisions about religious groups.

__Historical battles.__ Political scientist [Jeffrey Arnold](http://www.jrnold.me/) has converted the [U.S. Army Concepts Analysis Agency (CAA) Database of Battles](https://github.com/jrnold/CDB90/blob/master/src-data/M000121/README.TXT) from a series of Lotus 1-2-3 worksheets into [tidier, easier-to-use CSV files](https://github.com/jrnold/CDB90). The dataset includes details of 660 battles — associated with several dozen wars — between 1600 and the mid/late-1900s. The fields indicate each battle’s “name, date, and location; the strengths and losses on each side; identification of the victor; temporal duration of the battle,” and more.


__American radiation.__ The Environmental Protection Agency’s [RadNet system](https://www.epa.gov/radnet) “monitors the nation's air, precipitation and drinking water for radiation.” The radiation measurements, collected from 130+ stations in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, are [available on a “near-real-time” basis](https://www.epa.gov/radnet/near-real-time-and-laboratory-data-state). __Related:__ [Randall Munroe’s radiation dose chart](https://xkcd.com/radiation/). __Previously:__ [SafeCast](https://blog.safecast.org/about/) ([DIP 2016.02.03](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-02-03-edition)).

__Fellow mammals.__ The American Society of Mammalogists’ [Mammal Diversity Database](https://mammaldiversity.org/) “is home base for tracking the latest taxonomic changes to species and higher groups of mammals.” Currently, it contains more than 1,300 genera and 6,000 total species. __Fun facts:__ The impala is [the only member of the genus *Aepyceros*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impala), and the name “Schmidly's deer mouse” can refer to either of two species in two entirely different genera. [h/t [Himanshu Goenka](http://www.ibtimes.com/mammal-biodiversity-20-larger-previously-thought-new-database-find-2650075)]


__Rick and Morty.__ The (unofficial) [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) provides data on 390+ [characters](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation#character), 60+ [locations](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation#location), and all 31 [episodes](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation#episode) of [the science-fictional animated series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty).
