===================================

*FDA inspections, academic citations, Old and New Testament locations, university endowments, and tech products promoted.*


*üëã On Monday I launched the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/), a new initiative to identify, obtain, reformat, clean, document, publish, and disseminate government datasets of public interest. I invite you to [read more about it](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/about), [see the first batch of FOIA requests](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests), and [sign up for the project‚Äôs newsletter](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/newsletter). Questions and feedback very much welcome!*


__FDA inspections.__ The US Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs [inspections dashboard](https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/cd/inspections.htm) lists 264,000+ assessments of facilities (primarily those manufacturing food, drugs, and other FDA-regulated products) and 227,000+ problems the inspectors found. The fields include the facility owner, location, product type, inspection completion date, and outcomes. The records, which go back to fiscal year 2009, can be bulk-downloaded from the dashboard and queried via [an API](https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/api/index.htm). They come with certain caveats; they exclude, for instance, ‚Äúinspections waiting for a final enforcement action‚Äù and those conducted by state (rather than federal) inspectors. __Related__: [More compliance-related data dashboards from the FDA](https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/cd/index.htm).


__Academic citations.__ Since 2017, the [Initiative for Open Citations](https://i4oc.org/) has [urged academic publishers](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21800) to share their papers‚Äô reference lists as open data. Last month, the group [announced](https://twitter.com/i4oc_org/status/1560274192620085251) it had [hit a major milestone](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02926-y): Of the 61 million papers that have references and are indexed by [DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier)-registrar [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/), ‚Äú100% [...] have made their citations openly available.‚Äù You can access the data through [Crossref‚Äôs API](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/) and in bulk through [OpenCitations](https://opencitations.net/). __Read more__: ‚Äú[Citation data are now open, but that‚Äôs far from enough](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02915-1)‚Äù (Nature). __Previously__: [Wikipedia citations](https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/what-are-the-ten-most-cited-sources-on-wikipedia-lets-ask-the-data-34071478785a) ([DIP 2018.05.23](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-05-23-edition/)), [biomedical citations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000385) ([DIP 2019.10.23](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-10-23-edition/)), and [legal citations](https://case.law/download/citation_graph/) ([DIP 2020.07.15](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-07-15-edition/)).

__Old and New Testament locations.__ [OpenBible.info](https://www.openbible.info/)‚Äôs [Bible Geocoding](https://www.openbible.info/geo/) project ‚Äú(1) comprehensively identifies the possible modern locations of every place mentioned in the Bible as precisely as possible, (2) expresses a data-backed confidence level in each identification, and (3) links to open data to fit into a broader data ecosystem.‚Äù You can browse by book, chapter, and location, as well as [download the full dataset](https://github.com/openbibleinfo/Bible-Geocoding-Data). __Read more__: [The project‚Äôs author explains the backstory and methodology](https://www.openbible.info/blog/2021/11/rethinking-the-bible-atlas/).

__University endowments.__ Earlier this month, the [National Association of College and University Business Officers](https://www.nacubo.org/About/Who-We-Are) released the [latest](https://www.nacubo.org/Research/2021/NACUBO-TIAA-Study-of-Endowments) of its [annual studies of college and university endowments in the US and Canada](https://www.nacubo.org/Research/2021/Public-NTSE-Tables). For 700+ institutions, the study‚Äôs public tables indicate their total enrollment, endowment market value, previous year‚Äôs value, and more. A [page of historical datasets](https://www.nacubo.org/research/2021/historic%20endowment%20study%20data) includes a spreadsheet listing many endowments‚Äô sizes going back to the mid-1970s. [h/t [Factle](https://app.openaxis.com/visualizations/3698)]


__Tech products promoted.__ For ‚Äú[The Gamer and the Nihilist](https://components.one/posts/gamer-and-nihilist-product-hunt),‚Äù an essay in [Components](https://components.one/), [Andrew Thompson](https://twitter.com/asthompson) and collaborators created a [dataset of 76,000+ tech products](https://components.one/datasets/product-hunt-products) on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/about), a popular social network for launching and promoting such things. The dataset includes the name, description, launch date, upvote count, and other details for every product from 2014 to 2021 in the platform‚Äôs [sitemap](https://www.sitemaps.org/index.html). (‚ÄúBased on experience, not every product that appears on Product Hunt seems to appear on the sitemap,‚Äù the authors caution.)
