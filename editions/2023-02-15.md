__Fair market rents.__ Every year, the Department of Housing and Urban Development recalculates what it calls ‚Äúfair market rents‚Äù [for every county in the US](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html) and [for individual ZIP codes in metropolitan counties](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr/smallarea/index.html). The results, which factor into various housing subsidy programs, [represent](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/24/888.113) the 40th percentile cost of monthly rent and (basic) utilities for ‚Äúrecent movers‚Äù in ‚Äústandard quality‚Äù units, adjusted for the number of bedrooms. HUD‚Äôs annual spreadsheets go back to the early 2000s; you can also browse the estimates online and [query them via an API](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/dataset/fmr-api.html). __As seen in__: ‚Äú[Where are rents rising post COVID-19?](https://usafacts.org/articles/where-are-rents-rising-post-covid-19/)‚Äù (USAFacts).


__Humanitarian groups.__ ‚ÄúBased on clear and reproducible criteria,‚Äù [Clara Egger](https://claramarieegger.wordpress.com/) and [Doris Schopper](http://www.ge2p2.org/people/2018/10/12/doris-schopper-md-dph) have [compiled](https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/66/2/sqac009/6564592) the [Humanitarian Organizations Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/52GFWC), which describes 2,500+ groups active in the sector. It includes the organizations‚Äô founding years, structures, countries headquartered, regional scopes, types of activities, targets for assistance, and more. You can also [explore a version of the dataset online](https://humanitarianencyclopedia.org/community/organizations). __Related__: The [Global Database of Humanitarian Organisations](https://www.humanitarianoutcomes.org/projects/gdho), from [Humanitarian Outcomes](https://www.humanitarianoutcomes.org/about), ‚Äúa team of specialist consultants providing research and policy advice for humanitarian aid agencies and donor governments.‚Äù


__Diplomatic visits.__ The US Department of State‚Äôs [Office of the Historian](https://history.state.gov/) maintains a [dataset](https://github.com/HistoryAtState/visits) and [online directory](https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/visits) of every visit by a foreign leader from 1874 to 2020. The details include each visit‚Äôs starting and ending date, the visitor‚Äôs name, their country, and a brief description. The office publishes [similar data](https://github.com/HistoryAtState/travels) on the [travels of US presidents and secretaries of state](https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/travels). __Related__: [Matt Malis](https://mattmalis.github.io/) and [Alastair Smith](https://wp.nyu.edu/alastairsmith/) have [expanded the data for 1946‚Äì2019](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/2ZNR5R), adding fields that indicate the type of visit, whether it involved a presidential meeting, the names of agreements signed, and more. __Previously__: [Diplomatic gifts](https://github.com/tacookson/data/tree/master/us-government-gifts) ([DIP 2022.08.03](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-08-03-edition/)).


__Bog bodies.__ [Roy van Beek et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/bogs-bones-and-bodies-the-deposition-of-human-remains-in-northern-european-mires-9000-bcad-1900/B90A16A211894CB87906A7BCFC0B2FC7) ‚Äúpresent the first large-scale overview of well-dated human remains from northern European mires, based on a database of 266 sites and more than 1000 bog mummies, bog skeletons and disarticulated/partial skeletal remains.‚Äù The database, which can be found in the study‚Äôs [supplementary materials tab](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/bogs-bones-and-bodies-the-deposition-of-human-remains-in-northern-european-mires-9000-bcad-1900/B90A16A211894CB87906A7BCFC0B2FC7#supplementary-materials), indicates the bog bodies‚Äô location, year found, preservation level, sex, estimated age, assumed cause of death, and much more.

__Open Data Day events.__ [Open Data Day(s)](https://opendataday.org/), scheduled for March 4‚Äì10 this year, ‚Äúis an annual celebration of open data all over the world.‚Äù The [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/), which [helps to coordinate](https://blog.okfn.org/2023/02/07/open-data-days-2023-will-take-place-from-4th-to-10th-march/) the locally-organized gatherings, hosts a [searchable list](https://opendataday.org/events/2023/) of registered events, plus [datasets of each year‚Äôs events since 2014](https://github.com/okfn/opendataday/tree/master/Datasets).
