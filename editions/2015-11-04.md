Data Is Plural — 2015.11.04 edition
===================================

*Your weekly glimpse into the information-structuring habits of the human species.*

**Maternity leave policies at hundreds of American companies.** The 600+ entries in this [searchable, sortable database](https://fairygodboss.com/maternity-leave-resource-center) range from 3M to Amazon to Zynga, and list both paid and unpaid leave. The database, run by the women-in-the-workplace website [FairyGodBoss.com](https://www.fairygodboss.com/), culls from published policies and employee tips. An [introductory blog post](http://blog.fairygodboss.com/2015/10/21/our-maternity-leave-database-is-here/) provides more information.

**MoMA, mo’ data.** This July, the Museum of Modern Art published a [dataset containing 120,000 artworks from its catalog](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection), joining the UK’s [Tate](https://github.com/tategallery/collection), the Smithsonian’s [Cooper Hewitt](https://github.com/cooperhewitt/collection), and [other](http://www.penn.museum/collections/data.php) [forward-thinking](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/api) [museums](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/). The MoMA data contains the names of the artwork and artist, the dates created and acquired, and the medium — but no images.

**All licensed firearm dealers since 2010.** The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives publishes a [searchable and downloadable licensing database](https://data.atf.gov/Licensees/Federal-Firearms-Licensee-Listing-2010-to-2015/qg4c-kex6). License-holders fall into eleven categories. Among them: run-of-the-mill dealers, ammunition manufacturers, collectors of “[curios and relics](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/curios-relics),” pawnbrokers, and importers of “[destructive devices](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/firearms-guides-importation-verification-firearms-national-firearms-act-definitions-1).” The ATF’s website [contains monthly and state-by-state archives](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/listing-federal-firearms-licensees-ffls-2015).

**One thousand ways to say “dog.”** Trans-New Guinea is the world’s third-largest language family. But it’s also among the poorest-studied. [TransNewGuinea.org](http://transnewguinea.org/), an online database launched in 2013, is trying to change that. It now contains [more than 1,000 New Guinea languages](http://transnewguinea.org/language/) and lists 145,000 word translations — including [1,065 entries for “dog.”](http://transnewguinea.org/word/dog) It even [has an API](http://transnewguinea.org/api/v1/?format=json). A [recent PLOS ONE journal article](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141563) provides additional background and statistics. [h/t [Simon J.

**When planes attack.** Last May, a Gulfstream G150 taking off from Houston’s Ellington Airport struck an armadillo. The animal’s remains were collected, but were not sent to the Smithsonian Institution for identification. This anecdote comes from a single row in the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Wildlife Strike Database](http://wildlife.faa.gov/database.aspx), and draws on just seven of the 94 available fields. The database contains more than 168,000 strikes reported since 1990, almost all involving birds. Roughly 10% of the time, the animal's remains are sent to the [Smithsonian's Feather Identification Lab](http://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/wildlife/smithsonian/). [h/t [Dan Vergano](https://twitter.com/dvergano)]
