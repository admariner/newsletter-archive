Data Is Plural — 2016.04.27 edition
===================================

*FOIA, particle physics, flight delays, Congressional junkets, and an API far, far away.*

&nbsp;

**FOIA, four ways.** On Saturday, BuzzFeed hosted a [FOIA data hackathon](https://github.com/FOIA-data-hackathon/Planning/wiki). Participants used [datasets](https://github.com/FOIA-data-hackathon/Planning/wiki/Datasets) — from [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2016/apr/16/join-muckrock-and-buzzfeed-hack-foia-april-23rd/), [FOIA Machine](https://github.com/cirlabs/foiamachine/tree/master/stats), [FOIA Mapper](https://foiamapper.com/foia-downloads/), and [FOIA.gov](http://www.foia.gov/data.html) — to analyze federal, state, and local responsiveness to public records requests. The first three datasets contain details about individual FOIA requests and responses; FOIA.gov provides aggregate internal data from federal agencies.

**Particle physics.** Last week, the researchers at CERN’s Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment [released more than 300 terabytes of data](http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/cms-releases-new-batch-research-data-lhc). The [datasets](http://opendata.cern.ch/about/CMS) include raw particle-detection data from the Large Hadron Collider, as well as pre-processed datasets the researchers say “can be readily analysed by university or high-school students.” [h/t [Dad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-vine-a480347)]

**Flight delays.** The Bureau of Transportation Statistics requires the nation’s largest airlines to report [scheduled and actual timing data for every domestic flight](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&DB_Name=Airline%20On-Time%20Performance%20Data). The corresponding database includes information about delays, cancellations, and diversions, among other fields — and goes back to 1987. In January 2016, departing flights taxied for an average of 16 minutes, a minimum of 1 minute, and a maximum of 2 hours, 38 minutes. **Related:** “[Which Flight Will Get You There Fastest?](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/flights/)” [h/t [Tom Augspurger](http://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-1.html)]

&nbsp;

**Congressional junkets.** The U.S. House of Representatives requires all staff to reveal all “gift travel” — i.e., “free” trips that the government didn’t pay for. The Office of the Clerk compiles those filings into a [database containing each trip’s dates and sponsors](http://clerk.house.gov/public_disc/giftTravel.aspx). (The Consumer Electronics Show paid for 49 staffers and one congressman to visit the Las Vegas convention in January.) The Senate [publishes similar data](http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/g_three_sections_with_teasers/lobbyingdisc.htm#lobbyingdisc=grt), except it doesn’t include the sponsor name ... which kind of undermines the entire point.

**A long time ago, in an API far, far away.** The [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) provides programmatic access to data about every character, species, spaceship, planet, and film in George Lucas’ cinematic universe. You can also download [JSON files containing all the data](https://github.com/phalt/swapi/tree/master/resources/fixtures). [h/t [Robin Sloan](https://twitter.com/robinsloan)]
