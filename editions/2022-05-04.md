*üëã Do you have __piles of PDFs__ you‚Äôd like to turn into __structured data__? I‚Äôm trying something new and [starting a PDF-data-extraction consulting practice](https://www.jsvine.com/consulting/pdf-data-extraction). Interested? Just respond to this email with a brief summary of your project. Fees will depend on the specifics, but I plan on giving deep discounts to early clients.*


__Wastewater treatment plants.__ The [HydroWASTE](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/HydroWASTE_version_1_0/14847786/1) dataset, developed by McGill University geographers and engineers, [describes 58,000+ wastewater treatment plants around the world](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/559/2022/) and links them to downstream [river networks](https://www.hydrosheds.org/hydroatlas). Compiled from national and regional sources, HydroWASTE lists each facility‚Äôs name, country, status, estimated or official population served, geocoordinates, estimated discharge location, level of treatment, volume of discharge, and more. The US accounts for the most entries, with 14,000+, followed by Germany, Italy, France, and Brazil. [h/t [Michael F.

__COVID and wastewater, continued.__ [Earlier this year](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-01-26-edition/), DIP featured [wastewater sampling data from Biobot Analytics](https://github.com/biobotanalytics/covid19-wastewater-data), which partners with local governments to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in sewage. Since then, the CDC has [launched](https://coviddatadispatch.com/2022/02/06/the-cdc-is-finally-publishing-wastewater-data-but-only-ten-states-are-well-represented/) and [expanded](https://coviddatadispatch.com/2022/02/06/the-cdc-is-finally-publishing-wastewater-data-but-only-ten-states-are-well-represented/) a [wastewater surveillance module within its COVID data tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#wastewater-surveillance), displaying historically-relative virus concentrations from hundreds of sampling sites that participate in the agency‚Äôs [National Wastewater Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/surveillance/wastewater-surveillance/wastewater-surveillance.html); you can also [download the data in bulk](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/NWSS-Public-SARS-CoV-2-Wastewater-Data/2ew6-ywp6). __Read more__: [Betsy Ladyzhets](https://betsyladyzhets.com/), who runs the [COVID-19 Data Dispatch](https://coviddatadispatch.com/) (the source of most of the links above), recently [examined the state of wastewater monitoring for FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-national-fight-against-covid-19-isnt-ready-to-go-to-the-sewers/) and [interviewed a Twin Cities scientist about it](https://coviddatadispatch.com/2022/04/24/how-one-wastewater-plant-became-a-leading-covid-19-forecasting-source/). __Also__: ‚Äú[The Role of Wastewater Data in Pandemic Management](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/report/the-role-of-wastewater-data-in-pandemic-management/),‚Äù a report from The Rockefeller Foundation and partners.


__Regulatory agencies.__ [GlobalReg](https://www.globalreg.info/), a research group at the [Institut Barcelona d‚ÄôEstudis Internacionals](https://www.ibei.org/en/the-institution_25976), [studies](https://www.globalreg.info/who-we-are.html) ‚Äúthe spread of independent regulatory agencies worldwide.‚Äù Among its publications: [a dataset of 799 such agencies](https://www.globalreg.info/institutional-features-of-regulatory-agencies.html), spanning 100+ countries and 17 sectors. It lists each agency‚Äôs name, country, and sector as of 2010; groups each into one of six typological ‚Äúclusters‚Äù; and scores them on political independence, public accountability, managerial autonomy, and regulatory capabilities.


__NC corporate landlords.__ At least 40,000 single-family homes in North Carolina are owned by only roughly 20 investment corporations, according to a [new investigation by The News & Observer](https://www.newsobserver.com/topics/security_for_sale) and [The Charlotte Observer](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/topics/security_for_sale). In some neighborhoods, the companies own one-fifth of all such homes. To reach these findings, reporters used manual research and machine learning to compile a [now-public dataset](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/security_for_sale) of the companies, their subsidiaries, and the parcels they control. The parcel file draws substantially on [data from OneMap](https://www.nconemap.gov/pages/parcels), a state initiative to standardize county property records.

__Bats in caves.__ [Krizler C. Tanalgo et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01234-4)‚Äôs [DarkCideS](https://darkcides.org/) ‚Äúis by far the largest database for cave-dwelling bats,‚Äù [providing](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Metadata_for_DarkCideS_1_0_a_global_database_for_bats_in_karsts_and_caves/16413405) ‚Äúgeographical location, ecological status, species traits, and parasites and hyperparasites for 679 bat species,‚Äù plus 6,700+ observation records from 2,000+ caves in 40+ countries. __Read more__: [An introductory Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tkrizler/status/1511341433856606212).
