*Police data metadata, historical fishing intensity, Medicaid offices, Seine water quality, and human heights.*


*üì¨ Reader [Aditya Dahiya](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/) has used [data on movie theaters in eight Indian cities](https://github.com/HarshaDevulapalli/indian-movie-theatres) (featured in [DIP 2017.11.08](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-11-08-edition/)) and [Netflix viewership data](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-a-netflix-engagement-report) (featured in [DIP 2023.12.20](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-12-20-edition/)) to [demonstrate custom color scales and legends](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/ggplot2book3e/Chapter11.html) with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

__Police data metadata.__ The [Police Data Accessibility Project](https://pdap.io/) is compiling a [meta-dataset of police records](https://pdap.io/data): where to find them online, what time period they cover, how often they‚Äôre updated, and other characteristics. The [searchable](https://data-sources.pdap.io/), [downloadable](https://airtable.com/app473MWXVJVaD7Es/shrUAtA8qYasEaepI/tblx8XaKnFTphWNQM) dataset includes links to 1,700+ resources, such as traffic stop datasets, crime maps, use-of-force reports, contract and policy listings, and many other types of records, across hundreds of agencies. The team also maintains a [dataset of 23,000+ criminal legal agencies](https://airtable.com/app473MWXVJVaD7Es/shr43ihbyM8DDkKx4/tblpnd3ei5SlibcCX). __Related__: The [Vera Institute of Justice](https://www.vera.org/)‚Äôs [Police Data Transparency Index](https://policetransparency.vera.org/), which scored 90+ local police agencies across 10 categories of data transparency; [its methodology page](https://policetransparency.vera.org/#/Methodology) links to a more detailed, downloadable spreadsheet.


__Historical fishing intensity.__ [Yannick Rousseau et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02824-6) have generated a [series of datasets](https://metadata.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/1241a51d-c8c2-4432-aa68-3d2bae142794) estimating annual fishing effort from 1950 to 2017 by country, year, gear type, vessel length, sector (industrial, artisanal motorized, and artisanal unmotorized), and category of species targeted. The datasets provide ‚Äúinformation on number of vessels, engine power, gross tonnage, and nominal effort,‚Äù a metric that multiplies the engine power by the number of days at sea. Their sources include ‚Äúa range of publicly available sources, governmental reports, and grey literature‚Äù. __Related__: Co-author [Reg A. Watson](https://ecomarres.com/?page_id=24)‚Äôs [Global Fisheries Landings dataset](https://metadata.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/5c4590d3-a45a-4d37-bf8b-ecd145cb356d), which [estimates](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201739) ‚Äúcommercial, small-scale, illegal and unreported fisheries catch,‚Äù also since 1950. __Previously__: [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/)‚Äôs [fishing effort datasets](https://globalfishingwatch.org/dataset-and-code-fishing-effort/), based on vessel tracking signals ([DIP 2021.01.13](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-01-13-edition/)).


__Medicaid offices, geocoded.__ [Paul R. Shafer et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340924000416) have created a [dataset of 3,000+ Medicaid offices](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/AVRHMI) in the US, identified via state and county government websites. The team of Boston University researchers, who focused on ‚Äúpublic-facing Medicaid offices providing enrollment support,‚Äù have provided each office‚Äôs agency name, state, city, and address, and latitude/longitude coordinates (primarily sourced via the [US Census Bureau‚Äôs geocoder](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/)).


__Seine water quality.__ Ahead of the 2024 Summer Olympics, Paris has been [trying to decontaminate the Seine river](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/08/can-paris-clean-seine-for-next-year-2024-olympics) to swimmable levels. But the city‚Äôs efforts appear to be falling short, [according to government water testing data obtained, published, and analyzed](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/les-jeux-olympiques/paris-2024/enquete-franceinfo-paris-2024-pollution-trop-elevee-normes-non-respectees-ce-que-revelent-les-analyses-de-la-qualite-de-l-eau-de-la-seine_6173826.html) by [Mathieu Lehot-Couette](https://mastodon.zaclys.com/@math_lehot), a reporter at Franceinfo.fr. The [records include](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/les-jeux-olympiques/paris-2024-on-vous-explique-comment-franceinfo-a-analyse-les-donnees-sur-la-qualite-de-l-eau-de-la-seine_6252078.html) results from periodic samples taken at 14 points along the river, which Lehot-Couette has standardized into a spreadsheet of 1,400+ measurements of *E. coli* and [enterococci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus) between 2015 and 2023. 


__Human heights.__ Economic historians [J√∂rg Baten](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/wirtschafts-und-sozialwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/faecher/fachbereich-wirtschaftswissenschaft/wirtschaftswissenschaft/lehrstuehle/economics/economic-history/chair/prof-dr-joerg-baten/) and [Matthias Blum](https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/queens-business-school/people/academic-staff/AllAcademicStaffProfiles/Blum.html) have assembled a [dataset on average male heights by decade and country](https://clio-infra.eu/Indicators/Height.html). The estimates, derived from hundreds of scholarly and statistical sources, stretch back several centuries and span 140+ countries. A [related resource page](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/wirtschafts-und-sozialwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/faecher/fachbereich-wirtschaftswissenschaft/wirtschaftswissenschaft/lehrstuehle/volkswirtschaftslehre/wirtschaftsgeschichte/forschung/data-hub-height/) also provides individual-level data compiled by Baten and others, such as the heights of 1,000+ 19th-century Bavarian military conscripts.
