Data Is Plural — 2016.08.24 edition
===================================

*Crime in American cities, one billion healthcare claims, oil concessions, horse deaths, and traffic signs.*


__Crime in cities.__ The Marshall Project has [collected](https://github.com/themarshallproject/city-crime) and [analyzed](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/08/18/crime-in-context) four decades of FBI data “on the most serious violent crimes in 68 police jurisdictions.” The FBI data covers 1975 through 2014; the reporters “also obtained data directly from 61 local agencies for 2015 — a period for which the FBI has not yet released its numbers.” Between 2010 and 2015, violent crime increased most in Milwaukee (+11%) and declined most in Prince George’s County, Md. (-22%).


__One billion Australian healthcare claims.__ Australia’s Department of Health has recently released an [enormous dataset of Medicare and subsidized-prescription claims](https://data.gov.au/dataset/a8e3c0bc-44ac-4e9a-8b3c-b779438ddb10). It includes all claims from a random 10% sample of patients, and “contains approximately 1 billion lines of data relating to approximately 3 million Australians.” The Medicare claims go back to 1984, and the prescription claims go back to 2003.

__Oil concessions.__ The [OpenOil](http://openoil.net/) project aims to collect and standardizes data oil and gas development contracts around the world. So far, they’ve gathered [at least some data from more than 60 countries](http://repository.openoil.net/wiki/Concession_Layer_Methodology). They’ve also published a [map of oil concessions in the Middle East and Africa](http://maps.openoil.net/concessions/). [h/t [Michael Gardiner](https://twitter.com/___margs)]


__New York racehorse deaths and injuries.__ New York State tracks [every time a horse has been injured or died at a state race track](https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/Equine-Death-and-Breakdown/q6ts-kwhk) since March 2009. The dataset, which is updated often, also includes a few other types of incidents, such as when a rider falls or horse loses badly. __Related: “__[Horses’ Deaths at Aqueduct Prompt New Rules](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/sports/horses-deaths-at-aqueduct-prompt-new-rules.html).” [h/t [Mark Secada](https://tinyletter.com/united-states-of-data/letters/and-to-my-surprise-new-york-was-more-than-the-city)]


__German traffic signs:__ The [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) dataset contains 50,000+ images of 43 kinds of German traffic signs — from the classic “STOP,” to various speed limits, to roundabout indicators. The dataset, published by researchers at Ruhr-Universität Bochum’s Institut für Neuroinformatik, formed the basis of a 2011 machine-learning competition.
