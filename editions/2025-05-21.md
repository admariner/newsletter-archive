These include quantifications ‚Äî reported regularly by each state ‚Äî of claimant demographics, denials of eligibility, appeal caseloads, overpayments, disaster unemployment assistance, and much more. For example: Data from ETA 9050 reports, available monthly and going back to the late 1990s, indicate how many of each state‚Äôs claimants received their first payments within one week, two weeks, et cetera. The office also provides a [chartbook](https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/chartbook.asp) and various [report-generating tools](https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/DataDashboard.asp).
