*üì¨ Reader [Katie](https://katiemarriner.com) used the [National Database of Childcare Prices](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/topics/featured-childcare), featured in [DIP 2023.04.26](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-04-26-edition/), to create [an interactive tool for MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-rising-cost-of-childcare-is-making-life-impossible-for-parents-use-our-calculator-to-track-the-expense-where-you-live-355801c5); it compares the average costs in a given county to national averages, the local median income, and (optionally) your own income.

__International cancer statistics.__ The World Health Organization‚Äôs [Global Cancer Observatory](https://gco.iarc.fr/) provides [interfaces](https://gco.iarc.fr/projects) to a range of studies and statistics. Its [Cancer Today](https://gco.iarc.fr/today/home) portal features tables, charts, and maps of ‚Äúincidence, mortality and prevalence for year 2020 in 185 countries or territories for 36 cancer types by sex and age group.‚Äù Those figures come from the [latest GLOBOCAN estimates](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21660), calculated by the WHO‚Äôs [International Agency for Research on Cancer](https://www.iarc.who.int/) based on data from national and regional registries. __Note__: ‚ÄúCaution must be exercised when interpreting these estimates, given the limited quality and coverage of cancer data worldwide at present, particularly in low- and middle-income countries,‚Äù [the researchers warn](https://gco.iarc.fr/today/about). __Previously__: [Statistics from the American Cancer Society](https://cancerstatisticscenter.cancer.org/) ([DIP 2016.01.27](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-01-27-edition/)).


__SSVF satisfaction surveys.__ The Veterans Administration‚Äôs [Supportive Services for Veteran Families](https://www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf/index.html) program aims to ‚Äúto promote housing stability among very low-income Veteran families who reside in or are transitioning to permanent housing.‚Äù The VA outsources those services to a network of 200+ selected nonprofits, which it grants hundreds of millions of dollars per year. When a veteran exits a grantee‚Äôs program, they‚Äôre invited to complete a satisfaction survey. The [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/) (which, disclosure, I run) [filed a FOIA request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/ssvf-satisfaction-surveys/) for the survey data, and [received three spreadsheets in return](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/va-ssvf-survey-data/) (among other documents), [detailing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unanFEUnBDVBMK9pmpb0EVvRlpB-jtRC6gwlXSN-If4/edit) nearly 40,000 anonymized responses from fiscal years 2016‚Äì20 and 2022. 


__Katherine Dunham.__ [Dunham‚Äôs Data](https://dunhamsdata.org/), a project led by [Kate Elswit](https://www.kateelswit.org/) and [Harmony Bench](https://dance.osu.edu/people/bench.9), ‚Äúexplores the kinds of questions and problems that make the analysis and visualization of data meaningful for dance history, through the case study of 20th century African American choreographer Katherine Dunham‚Äù ([1909‚Äì2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Dunham)). Drawing on materials ‚Äúheld by seven archives across the United States,‚Äù the team has built [three core datasets](https://dunhamsdata.org/portfolio/datasets), accompanied by [essays](https://dunhamsdata.org/index.php/portfolio/essays), [visualizations](https://dunhamsdata.org/index.php/portfolio/visualizations), and [code repositories](https://dunhamsdata.org/blog/code-tutorial-release). They ‚Äúdocument the daily itinerary of Dunham‚Äôs touring and travel from the 1930s-60s; the over 300 dancers, drummers, and singers who appeared with her; and the shifting configurations of the nearly 300 repertory entities they performed.‚Äù [h/t [Selena Chau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/selenachau/)]


__Singaporean wages.__ Singapore‚Äôs Ministry of Manpower released its [2022 wage tables](https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Occupational-Wages-Tables2022.aspx) last month. The tables list the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of basic and gross wages for more than 300 occupations by industry, plus median wages by worker sex, by worker age, and by establishment size. __As seen in__: [The Straits Times‚Äô benchmarking tool](https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2023/07/salary-guide-2023/index.html) and DIP reader [Joses Ho](https://www.josesho.com/)‚Äôs [interactive chart of Singapore‚Äôs gender wage gaps](https://observablehq.com/@josesho/singapore-gender-wage-gap-2022).


__Scotland‚Äôs Common Good.__ Scotland‚Äôs [Common Good Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/aosp/1491/19/introduction), passed in 1491, creates a legal distinction for historical property owned by local authorities ‚Äî often land and buildings, but also ‚Äúmoveable assets‚Äù such as paintings, [chains of office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery_collar), and furniture. [CommonGood.scot](https://commongood.scot/), [launched in April](https://commongood.scot/launching-commongood-scot/) by investigative journalism cooperative [The Ferret](https://theferret.scot/about-us/), presents a [searchable](https://commongood.scot/search/), [browsable](https://commongood.scot/map/), and [downloadable](https://commongood.scot/data/) dataset of 2,900+ of these common good assets, [compiled](https://commongood.scot/faqs-common-good-funds/) largely through freedom of information requests.
