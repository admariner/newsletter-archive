Data Is Plural — 2016.11.02 edition
===================================

*Medicare beneficiaries, human settlement, Amazon reviews, NYC police complaints, and dangerous dogs.*

&nbsp;

**Medicare beneficiaries.** The U.S. government’s [Medicare Health Outcomes Survey](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/23380?classification=ICPSR.IX.&q=&sortBy=7) tracks the “physical and mental health and well-being” of Americans covered by Medicare. Each survey, currently available for 1998–2000 to 2012–2014, follows a sample of Medicare beneficiaries for two years, and asks them questions along the lines of, “In the past 12 months, have you had a problem with balance or walking?” The 2012–2014 data includes (at least partial) responses from 296,320 people.

**Where we live and build.** The European Commission’s [Global Human Settlement Layer](http://ghslsys.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php) combines satellite imagery and census data to measure three things: population, building density, and urban/rural classification. The [resulting datasets](http://ghslsys.jrc.ec.europa.eu/datasets.php) are fairly detailed — they provide population estimates for every 250-meter square in the world, for example — and are available for 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2015.

**Complaints against NYC police.** Earlier this autumn, New York City began publishing a [dataset of official citizen complaints against the city’s police](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/policy/data-transparency-initiative.page), for every case closed since 2006. For each of the 200,000+ allegations, the main dataset includes various details about the incident — e.g., where it took place, and whether there’s video evidence — but no information about the officer involved. **Related:** [Similar data from Indianapolis](https://www.projectcomport.org/department/IMPD/), which includes demographic information about the complained-against officers but not their names. **Also related:** “[The local projects that are making police complaint data open and accessible](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/10/25/the-local-projects-that-are-making-police-complaint-data-open-and-accessible/).” **Previously:** [Complaints against Chicago police](https://cpdb.co/), [featured Nov. 11, 2015](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2015-11-25-edition).

**Millions of Amazon reviews.** [Julian McAuley](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/), an assistant professor at UC San Diego, has collected a massive amount of user-generated data from Amazon.com, including [142.8 million reviews](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) and [1.4 million answered Q&As](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/qa/). (As of mid-2014, [Sophie la Girafe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IDSLOG) was the most-reviewed item in the baby category. Backstory [here](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/number_1/2011/03/im_french_chew_on_me.html).) Much of the data can be downloaded directly, but the largest files require contacting McAuley for access.

**The dangerous dogs of Austin, Texas.** The city publishes a [spreadsheet](https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/Declared-Dangerous-Dogs/ykw4-j3aj) — last updated in May — of local dogs who’ve officially been “declared dangerous.” (“They have attacked in the past. The owner is required to provide $100,000 in financial responsibility. If they attack again the court could order them put to sleep.”) The file currently contains 63 entries, from a Labrador named Charlie to a Blue Lacy named Flint.
