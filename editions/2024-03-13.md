*Humanitarian emergency mapping, materials and their properties, EU infringements, NYC council members, and counting fish.*


*üì¨ Reader¬†[Jack T.](https://jackturek708.com/) has built an [interactive map](https://jturek.shinyapps.io/educational_gag_orders_egos/) of the [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tj5WQVBmB6SQg-zP_M8uZsQQGH09TxmBY73v23zpyr0/edit#gid=1505554870) on ‚Äúeducational gag orders‚Äù compiled by [PEN America](https://pen.org/report/Americas-censored-classrooms/), featured in [DIP¬†2022.08.24](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-08-24-edition/).

__Humanitarian emergency mapping.__ The [United Nations Satellite Centre](https://unosat.org/) (UNOSAT) provides a [range of services](https://unosat.org/services/) to UN agencies and the general public, including [downloadable maps, data, and analyses](https://unosat.org/products/) produced ‚Äúin response to humanitarian emergencies related to disasters, complex emergencies and conflict situations.‚Äù Those currently available include assessments of [flood impacts in Libya](https://unosat.org/products/3800), [landslides in the Republic of the Congo](https://unosat.org/products/3798), and [building damage in the Gaza Strip](https://unosat.org/products/3793). The latter identifies structures that satellite imagery suggests have been damaged; the data indicate each building‚Äôs location and damage level, plus an assessment confidence and notes. Assessments for prior humanitarian emergencies can be found by adjusting the [listing page](https://unosat.org/products/)‚Äôs filters, and also via [UNOSAT‚Äôs contributions to the Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/organization/unosat).

__Materials and their properties.__ The [Materials Project](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/), [led by scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/about/people), ‚Äúis a multi-institution, multi-national effort to compute the properties of all inorganic materials‚Äù with the ‚Äú[ultimate goal](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/about)‚Äù being ‚Äúto drastically reduce the time needed to invent new materials.‚Äù Its [online explorer](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials) and [API](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/api) currently provide information about 150,000+ materials. You can search by component elements, formula, thermodynamics, structural properties, magnetism, elasticity, and many other characteristics.


__EU infringements.__ The European Commission publishes a [searchable and downloadable database](https://ec.europa.eu/atwork/applying-eu-law/infringements-proceedings/infringement_decisions/) of all its decisions regarding national infringements of [EU regulations, decisions, and directives](https://commission.europa.eu/law/application-eu-law/implementing-eu-law_en). It currently contains 58,000+ decisions in 24,000+ cases, going back to the late 1980s. (To download the full database, conduct a blank search and then click the ‚ÄúExport to Excel‚Äù link.) Each entry lists a decision type and date, case identifier, country, policy area, and more. Recent examples include the Commission‚Äôs decisions to refer Ireland to court for [failing to protect its peat bogs](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1232) and Italy for [noncompliance with a wastewater treatment directive](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1234).

__NYC council members.__ [Maximum New York](https://www.maximumnewyork.com/about) has [published](https://www.maximumnewyork.com/p/city-council-data-project) a [biographical dataset of people elected to the New York City Council](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11kMfI0iY4CSYrrwoUSM1oERm_bOYtbZI379N1wX3QO4/edit). For each member since 1998 (plus some before that), it lists their name, district, borough, political party, date of birth, undergraduate/graduate universities and fields of study, whether they ever served on a community board, prior employer, and more. __Related__: [DataMade](https://datamade.us/)‚Äôs [Chicago Councilmatic](https://chicago.councilmatic.org/) lists all members, bills, votes, and meetings, and is also [available](https://puddle.datamade.us/) as [structured data](https://puddle.bunkum.us/chicago_council).

__Counting fish.__ The University of Washington‚Äôs [Columbia Basin Research](https://www.cbr.washington.edu/) provides ([among other data](https://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart)) [daily, species-level counts of adult salmon and trout](https://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_daily) passing through [more than a dozen sites](https://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/metadata/adult) in the Pacific Northwest. [CalFish](https://www.calfish.org/AboutCalFish/AboutCalFish.aspx) publishes [fish counts and population estimates for the Upper Sacramento River Basin](https://www.calfish.org/ProgramsData/ConservationandManagement/CentralValleyMonitoring/CDFWUpperSacRiverBasinSalmonidMonitoring.aspx), which ‚Äúcontains much of California‚Äôs salmon and steelhead populations.‚Äù Similar resources include those available from [Alaska](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/sf/FishCounts/), [Oregon](https://myodfw.com/fish-counts-major-dams-and-fish-traps), and the [Yakama Nation](https://yakamafish-nsn.gov/fish-data).
