*üì¨ Reader [Aditya Dahiya](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/) has built a [showcase of his Data Is Plural‚Äìinspired visualizations](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/projects_presentations/projects/dip_viz.html). ‚ÄúHere, you‚Äôll find open-source code detailing every step, from data acquisition to final rendering,‚Äù Aditya writes.

__Human trafficking.__ The [Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/page/about)‚Äôs [Global Synthetic Dataset](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/page/global-synthetic-dataset) uses [differential privacy techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) to represent ‚Äúover 206,000 victims and survivors of trafficking identified across 190 countries and territories from 2002 to 2022.‚Äù The approach, developed in partnership with Microsoft Research, converts anonymized case records into ‚Äúa new dataset in which records do not correspond to actual individuals, but which preserves the structure and statistics (i.e., utility) of the original data.‚Äù Each row indicates a (synthetic) individual‚Äôs gender, age group, citizenship, country of exploitation, duration of reported trafficking, traffickers‚Äô means of control, types of exploitation, and the year the [collaborative‚Äôs partners](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/data-contributors) registered the case. __Related__: The collaborative‚Äôs [Global Victim-Perpetrator Synthetic Dataset](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/global-victim-perpetrator-synthetic-dataset), which takes a similar approach to relationships between victims and perpetrators.

__Real-world vehicle emissions.__ On Monday, the European Commission [published its first report](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/news-your-voice/news/first-commission-report-real-world-co2-emissions-cars-and-vans-using-data-board-fuel-consumption-2024-03-18_en) analyzing [the real-world CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of cars and vans](https://climate-energy.eea.europa.eu/topics/transport/real-world-emissions/intro), based on fuel consumption monitoring devices that the EU now requires. The report uses data received from 600,000+ vehicles. That sample is [available to download](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/1c1ffad2-34c3-471b-bd69-dd013cdd7b80), along with [metrics aggregated by manufacturer and fuel type](https://climate-energy.eea.europa.eu/topics/transport/real-world-emissions/data): average fuel consumption, emissions, and comparisons to [standardized test results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Harmonised_Light_Vehicles_Test_Procedure). __Related__: [Data on millions of EU car registrations](https://co2cars.apps.eea.europa.eu/) (and [van registrations](https://co2vans.apps.eea.europa.eu/)), including each vehicle‚Äôs fuel economy and emissions ratings. __Previously__: [FuelEconomy.gov](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/) ([DIP 2017.04.12](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-04-12-edition/)), with [data](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml) on decades of car models.

__State legislators.__ [Nicholas Carnes](https://people.duke.edu/~nwc8/index.html) and [Eric Hansen](https://ehansen4.sites.luc.edu/)‚Äôs [2023-4 State Legislators Dataset](https://people.duke.edu/~nwc8/stateleg.html) features ‚Äúbiographical information about state lawmakers who held office in 2023 and 2024 compiled from legislative and campaign websites and other online sources.‚Äù The dataset spans all 50 states and includes 7,300+ lawmakers. ‚ÄúThe project‚Äôs principal aim was to record the current or most recent main occupation (outside of elected office) held by each member,‚Äù the authors write, ‚Äúbut the dataset also includes information about a wide range of characteristics including race, gender, and education.‚Äù A version for 2021‚Äì22 is [also available](https://people.duke.edu/~nwc8/stateleg.html). __Previously__: [State legislator financial disclosures](https://github.com/PublicI/state-lawmakers-disclosures) ([DIP 2017.12.13](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-12-13-edition/)) and [ideology scores](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/bshor) ([DIP 2020.01.01](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-01-01-edition/)).

__Meta Oversight Board decisions.__ Meta‚Äôs independent [Oversight Board](https://oversightboard.com/) reviews a selection of the company‚Äôs content-moderation decisions and has the power to overturn them. The board [publishes its rulings online](https://oversightboard.com/decision/), as does [Meta itself](https://transparency.fb.com/oversight/oversight-board-cases/); neither, however, provides a download link. But [Information Is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/) has compiled a [spreadsheet of the board‚Äôs 80+ decisions through early February](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kz7nYnfTM3al6dIJgqYwR4DMPal5d37vKPOBAqD3mRY/edit#gid=655704690), supporting a [visualization of the cases‚Äô topics and outcomes over time](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/facebook-meta-oversight-board-decisions-major-rulings/).

__Aviation waypoints.__ For his [recent exploration of the FAA‚Äôs aviation maps](https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/faa-aviation-maps/), [Beautiful Public Data](https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/)‚Äôs [Jon Keegan](https://www.threads.net/@jonkeeganstories) has turned the agency‚Äôs [list of 67,000+ navigation waypoints](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/aero_data/loc_id_search/fixes_waypoints/) into a [downloadable dataset](https://github.com/jonkeegan/faa-navigation-waypoints). ‚ÄúOften these waypoint names will reflect the culture, food or sports teams of the city they are near,‚Äù Keegan writes. ‚ÄúOff the coast of New England, there is [LBSTA](https://nfdc.faa.gov/nfdcApps/services/ajv5/fix_search.jsp?selectType=state&selectName=ME&keyword=LBSTA) and [WHALE](https://nfdc.faa.gov/nfdcApps/services/ajv5/fix_search.jsp?selectType=state&selectName=MA&keyword=WHALE). Boston‚Äôs sports legacy gave us [BOSOX](https://nfdc.faa.gov/nfdcApps/services/ajv5/fix_search.jsp?selectType=state&selectName=MA&keyword=BOSOX), [BRUWN](https://nfdc.faa.gov/nfdcApps/services/ajv5/fix_search.jsp?selectType=state&selectName=MA&keyword=BRUWN), [CELTS](https://nfdc.faa.gov/nfdcApps/services/ajv5/fix_search.jsp?selectType=state&selectName=MA&keyword=CELTS), [PATSS](https://nfdc.faa.gov/nfdcApps/services/ajv5/fix_search.jsp?selectType=state&selectName=MA&keyword=PATSS), [FENWY](https://nfdc.faa.gov/nfdcApps/services/ajv5/fix_search.jsp?selectType=state&selectName=MA&keyword=FENWY), [ORRRR](https://nfdc.faa.gov/nfdcApps/services/ajv5/fix_search.jsp?selectType=state&selectName=MA&keyword=ORRRR) and [BORQE](https://nfdc.faa.gov/nfdcApps/services/ajv5/fix_search.jsp?selectType=state&selectName=MA&keyword=BORQE). Salem has [WITCH](https://nfdc.faa.gov/nfdcApps/services/ajv5/fix_search.jsp?selectType=state&selectName=MA&keyword=WITCH), and Plymouth has [PLGRM](https://nfdc.faa.gov/nfdcApps/services/ajv5/fix_search.jsp?selectType=state&selectName=MA&keyword=PLGRM).‚Äù
