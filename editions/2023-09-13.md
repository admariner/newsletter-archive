*üîÑ The Washington Post has [obtained and published five more years of prescription opioid data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2023/opioid-epidemic-pain-pills-sold-oxycodone-hydrocodone/) (initially featured in [DIP 2019.08.07](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-08-07-edition/)).

__Political contributions, enhanced.__ Political scientist [Adam Bonica](https://web.stanford.edu/~bonica/)‚Äôs [Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections](https://data.stanford.edu/dime) (DIME) gathers ‚Äú500 million itemized political contributions made by individuals and organizations to local, state, and federal elections covering from 1979 to 2020.‚Äù The project, which received a [major update last month](https://listserv.wustl.edu/scripts/wa.exe?A2=1702A&L=POLMETH&D=0&H=N&P=6749708), ‚Äúis intended to make data on campaign finance and elections (1) more centralized and accessible, (2) easier to work with, and (3) more versatile [‚Ä¶].‚Äù It assigns each contributor a unique identifier, geocodes their stated addresses, quantifies their ideological orientation, and more. The raw data come from several sources, including the [Federal Election Commission](https://www.fec.gov/data/) and [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/). __Related__: [MoneyInPolitics.wtf](https://moneyinpolitics.wtf/), a [collaborative project](https://moneyinpolitics.wtf/about/) that aims to be ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs most comprehensive dictionary of campaign finance jargon.‚Äù [h/t [Isadora Borges Monroy](https://twitter.com/1sadoraB)]


__Historical newspaper articles.__ [Melissa Dell et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12477)‚Äôs [American Stories dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dell-research-harvard/AmericanStories) contains the text of ~400 million newspaper articles, extracted from ~20 million public-domain scans in the Library of Congress‚Äôs [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) project ([DIP 2017.08.16](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-08-16-edition/)). To construct the dataset, the authors [built](https://github.com/dell-research-harvard/AmericanStories) ‚Äúa novel deep learning pipeline that incorporates layout detection, legibility classification, custom OCR, and the association of article texts spanning multiple bounding boxes.‚Äù For each article, the dataset provides the newspaper name, edition number, date of publication (largely in the 1800s‚Äì1920s), page number, headline, byline, and article text. __Previously__: The LOC‚Äôs [Newspaper Navigator dataset](https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/) ([DIP 2020.10.07](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-10-07-edition/)), which extracts visual content from the Chronicling America scans.

__Prigozhin audio messages.__ [Giorgio Comai](https://giorgiocomai.eu/) has [collected and auto-transcribed](https://tadadit.xyz/posts/2023-08-telegram_prigozhin/) hundreds of audio messages from Russian mercenary leader [Yevgeny Prigozhin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Prigozhin), which were posted ‚Äúon his official Telegram channel - the press service of his holding company‚Äù from late 2022 through June 2023. For each transcribed segment within each message, the [resulting datasets](https://tadadit.xyz/datasets/prigozhin_audio_files/) (one in Russian and one auto-translated into English) include the message ID, time posted, segment timestamp, and segment text.

__The ‚ÄúUnknome.‚Äù__ The human genome has been sequenced, but what do all those genes do? [Jo√£o J. Rocha et al.](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002222)‚Äôs [Unknome database](https://unknome.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/) assigns a ‚Äúknownness‚Äù score to ‚Äúall protein clusters that contain at least 1 protein from humans or any of 11 model organisms.‚Äù The score is based on the density of annotations in the [Gene Ontology knowledgebase](https://geneontology.org/), which bills itself as ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs largest source of information on the functions of genes.‚Äù The clustering comes from another downloadable database, [PANTHER](https://pantherdb.org/), which contains ‚Äúcomprehensive information about the evolution of protein-coding gene families.‚Äù


__License plate designs.__ [Beautiful Public Data](https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/)‚Äôs [Jon Keegan](https://jonkeegan.com/) scraped the websites of every US state‚Äôs (and DC‚Äôs) motor vehicle agency to assemble a [dataset of 8,291 license plate designs](https://github.com/jonkeegan/us-license-plates). The dataset provides each design‚Äôs name, state, and image. __Read more__: [Keegan‚Äôs exploration of the data](https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/all-of-the-license-plates-in-the-united-states/), which includes a searchable table. __Previously__: Vanity plates requested in [California](https://github.com/veltman/ca-license-plates) ([DIP 2020.01.29](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-01-29-edition/)) and [New York](https://github.com/datanews/license-plates) ([DIP 2015.10.21](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2015-10-21-edition/)).
