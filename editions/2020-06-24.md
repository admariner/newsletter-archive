Data Is Plural — 2020.06.24 edition
===================================

*New policing bills, Indigenous lands, The Gay Guides, coronavirus-era child care, and Ancient Rome.*


__New policing bills.__ The [National Conference of State Legislatures](https://www.ncsl.org) has built a [database of state-level policing bills and executive orders](https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/legislative-responses-for-policing.aspx) introduced since May 25, the day George Floyd was killed. The database covers proposed bills on “oversight and data, training, standards and certification, use of force, technology, policing alternatives and collaboration, [...] and other timely issues.” So far, it contains brief descriptions, author information, statuses, and last-activity dates for more than 250 pieces of legislation in 25 states and DC. Although the database does not provide downloads, its HTML output is highly structured. __Related__: Last week, The Marshall Project’s [Weihua Li](https://twitter.com/Weihua_Li1), [Humera Lodhi](https://twitter.com/HumeraLodhi), and [Damini Sharma](https://twitter.com/sharmad23) [analyzed the database and put the bills in context](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/06/18/which-states-are-taking-on-police-reform-after-george-floyd).


__Indigenous lands.__ [Native-Land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) maps the historical geographic extents of Indigenous territories in North America, Australia, New Zealand, parts of South America, and elsewhere. The [project’s datasets](https://native-land.ca/api-docs/) cover 1,400+ territories, 900+ languages, and 800+ related treaties, drawn from [a wide range of resources](https://native-land.ca/resources/). It was launched in 2015 by programmer [Victor Temprano](http://victortemprano.com) and is [now run by a not-for-profit organization with a board of directors](https://native-land.ca/about/). __Related__: Earlier this year, High Country News published [Land-Grab Universities](https://www.landgrabu.org), a “two-year inquiry into the origin of wealth that undergirds the nation’s system of higher education,” accompanied by a [detailed methodology](https://www.hcn.org/articles/indigenous-affairs-education-how-we-investigated-the-land-grant-university-system) and [dataset](https://github.com/HCN-Digital-Projects/landgrabu-data) spanning nearly 11 million acres of expropriated Indigenous land.


__The Gay Guides.__ [Mapping the Gay Guides](https://www.mappingthegayguides.org) “aims to understand often ignored queer geographies using the Damron Address Books, an early but longstanding travel guide aimed at gay men since the early 1960s.” The project — [launched earlier this year](https://www.mappingthegayguides.org/2020/02/announcing-the-launch-of-mapping-the-gay-guides/) and [led by](https://mappingthegayguides.org/about/) historians [Amanda Regan](https://mappingthegayguides.org/regan/) and [Eric Gonzaba](https://mappingthegayguides.org/gonzaba/) — includes an [interactive map](https://mappingthegayguides.org/map/), [downloadable dataset](https://github.com/MappingtheGayGuides/MGG-Data), [methodology](https://mappingthegayguides.org/methodology/), and [ethics statement](https://mappingthegayguides.org/ethics/). It already covers more than 22,000 entries in more than 30 states, with plans for further expansion. [h/t [Giuseppe Sollazzo](https://mailchi.mp/42557319b05d/preview-222-in-other-news-3837485)]


__Coronavirus-era child care.__ Economist and parenting book–author [Emily Oster](https://emilyoster.net/) has been [collecting](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYIy0Dc9PW9sWCSWNXypw36FLoMiSx9jDalgDPcccK4T7ezQ/viewform) and [publishing](https://twitter.com/ProfEmilyOster/status/1275044876133044225) “preliminary, unscientific data on child care centers which were open in the pandemic.” The [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L45r63t8hpYfGLpT6gWKjYMscu8Wut6jtlxO-1FAW9c/edit) currently includes more than 900 centers, their locations, age ranges served, whether they were open the whole time or just part of it, the number of students and staff, and the number of COVID-19 cases in students and staff.

__These datasets lead to Rome.__ The [Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilizations](https://darmc.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University “makes freely available on the internet the best available materials for [...] mapping and spatial analysis of the Roman and medieval worlds.” The project’s [datasets](https://darmc.harvard.edu/data-availability) include economic indicators, climate records, ports and harbors, shipwrecks, roads, and more.
