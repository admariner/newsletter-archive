*Civilian harm in Ukraine, aid for Ukraine, municipal incorporations, political podcasts, and stop signs.*


__Civilian harm in Ukraine.__ Researchers at [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/about/) and contributors to its [Global Authentication Project](https://www.sidn.nl/en/news-and-blogs/bellingcat-uses-open-source-information-to-expose-wrongdoing) have [assembled](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/02/24/russias-assault-on-daily-life-in-ukraine/) a [map and dataset of 1,000+ incidents](https://ukraine.bellingcat.com/) “that have resulted in potential civilian impact or harm since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.” They include incidents “where rockets or missiles struck civilian areas,” “where attacks have resulted in the destruction of civilian infrastructure,” and/or where visual evidence depicts civilian injuries or “immobile civilian bodies.” The information, [collected from public sources and vetted by Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2022/03/17/hospitals-bombed-and-apartments-destroyed-mapping-incidents-of-civilian-harm-in-ukraine/), includes each incident’s date, location, description, sources, type of area affected, and type of weapon system (if known).

__Aid for Ukraine.__ [Christoph Trebesch et al.](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/kiel-working-papers/2022/the-ukraine-support-tracker-which-countries-help-ukraine-and-how-17204/)’s [Ukraine Support Tracker](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/) “lists and quantifies military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war.” The 1,400+ entries in the [tracker’s dataset](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/data-sets/ukraine-support-tracker-data-17410/) include contributions and commitments from 40 governments, plus several European Union institutions. (It does not include aid from NGOs and other non-state entities.) Each entry indicates the country, announcement date, type of aid, total value, description, sources, and more. The tracker’s next update is scheduled for March 29.


__Municipal incorporations.__ [Christopher B. Goodman](https://cgoodman.com/), a professor of public administration, has consulted a range of state-level sources to compile a [dataset listing the year of incorporation](https://github.com/cbgoodman/muni-incorporation) for 18,000+ municipalities in the United States. The dataset, which covers nearly 96% of all active municipalities, also provides each place’s name, state, coordinates, canonical ID in the Census, and more. __Read more__: In a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/cbgoodman/status/1631705180201943040), Goodman explains why he undertook the effort and shares a couple of visualizations.

__Political podcasts.__ The [Popular Political Podcast Dataset](https://politicalpodcastproject.shinyapps.io/dataset/), developed by the Brookings Institution’s [Valerie Wirtschafter](https://www.brookings.edu/author/valerie-wirtschafter/) and [Chris Meserole](https://www.brookings.edu/experts/chris-meserole/), covers 50,000+ episodes from 100+ “prominent political podcast series” — the latter based on Apple Podcasts’ popularity rankings and its “You Might Also Like” recommendations. Updated daily and explorable online, the dataset provides each episode’s name, description, air date, and URL, plus the series name, partisan leaning, and Apple Podcasts category.


__Stop signs.__ The City of Los Angeles publishes the [location and orientation of 50,000+ local stop signs](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lahub::stop-and-yield-signs/about) (plus a few yield signs). Other cities offering similar datasets include [Houston](https://geohub.houstontx.gov/datasets/625faeaffe924a0c968f216bf3c321fc_1/about), [San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Stop-Signs/4542-gpa3), [Detroit](https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/detroitmi::traffic-sign-locations/about), [Topeka](https://data.topeka.org/datasets/Topeka::topeka-stop-signs/about), [Menlo Park](https://data.menlopark.org/datasets/MenloPark::stop-signs/about), and [London, Ontario](https://opendata.london.ca/datasets/51b53a163cf64681a057c397208637d6_5/about). __Related__: [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)’s [dataset](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Downloading_data) features [nearly 1.4 million stop signs](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dstop) located [across the world](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/highway%3Dstop#map).
