Data Is Plural — 2018.05.23 edition
===================================

*Ebola, public transit, political resistance campaigns, wind, and Wikipedia’s citations.*

**Ebola.** [Caitlin Rivers](http://www.caitlinrivers.com/), a computational epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, has started compiling [data tracking the current Ebola outbreak](https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola_drc) in the Democratic Republic of Congo. So far, the datasets are based on case counts and other information from the DRC’s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization. A series of “data interpretation notes” accompanies each dataset. (Rivers administered a [similar data repository during the 2014 Ebola outbreak](https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola).) **Related:** “[Most Maps of the New Ebola Outbreak Are Wrong](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/most-maps-of-the-new-ebola-outbreak-are-wrong/560777/),” by Ed Yong.

**Public transit, curated.** As a way to “lower the barrier“ for analyzing public transportation data, researchers at Finland’s Aalto University [have published](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201889) “a curated collection of [now more than] 25 cities' public transport networks in multiple easy-to-use formats including network edge lists, temporal network event lists, SQLite databases, GeoJSON files, and the GTFS data format.” On [the project’s website](http://transportnetworks.cs.aalto.fi/), you can browse, visualize, and download each city’s data. (The cities are mostly in Europe and Australia, but also include Detroit, Winnipeg, and Antofagasta, Chile.) **Previously:** [TransitLand](https://transit.land/) and [TransitFeeds](https://transitfeeds.com/) ([DIP 2016.07.27](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-07-27-edition)).

**Political resistance campaigns.** The [Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) Data Project](https://www.du.edu/korbel/sie/research/chenow_navco_data.html), based at the University of Denver, “catalogues major nonviolent and violent resistance campaigns around the globe from 1900-2013.” The project’s initial dataset explored the general characteristics of hundreds of campaigns; follow-up datasets have examined the annual activity and tactics of smaller subsets. Each dataset comes with a detailed codebook. **Note:** Free registration is required to download the most recent datasets.

**Wind.** Earlier this month, the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory [made a big new slice](https://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2018/nrel-releases-major-update-to-wind-energy-dataset.html) of its [Wind Integration National Dataset](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/wind-toolkit.html) available online. The latest version provides [API access](https://github.com/NREL/hsds-examples) to 50 terabytes of wind-related measurements — about 10% of the full database. It includes “barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, relative humidity, temperature, and air density data” between 2007 and 2013, from nearly 5 million locations in/near the continental United States. The NREL has also published [an animated map of the data](https://nrel.github.io/hsds-viz/). **Note:** Free registration is required to access the API. **Previously:** [Wind turbines](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/) ([DIP 2018.04.25](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2018-04-25-edition)).

**What Wikipedians cite.** The Wikimedia Foundation [has published](https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/what-are-the-ten-most-cited-sources-on-wikipedia-lets-ask-the-data-34071478785a) a [dataset listing each clearly-cited source](https://figshare.com/articles/Wikipedia_Scholarly_Article_Citations/1299540) (e.g., a book with an ISBN, a scholarly article with a DOI, etc.) on each page of each of Wikipedia’s 298 languages editions — 15,693,732 source-page combinations in all. **Related:** “[The Most-Cited Authors on Wikipedia Had No Idea](https://www.wired.com/story/wikipedia-most-cited-authors-no-idea/),” by Louise Matsakis.
