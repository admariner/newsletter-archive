__Dengue.__ [OpenDengue](https://opendengue.org/), a new project based at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, ‚Äúaims to build and maintain a database of dengue case counts for every dengue-affected country worldwide since 1990 or earlier.‚Äù (According to a [2013 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12060) [cited by the WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue), the virus causes an estimated 96 million symptomatic infections per year.) [Drawing from a range of sources](https://opendengue.org/overview.html), the team has collected weekly, monthly, and/or annual national counts from 100+ countries so far and [welcomes contributions](https://opendengue.org/contribute.html). For each count, the [project‚Äôs datasets](https://opendengue.org/data.html) indicate what was being counted: suspected cases, confirmed cases, probable cases, or a combination. For several dozen countries, the data also contain sub-national counts ‚Äî including for 5,000+ municipalities in Brazil and all 70+ Thai provinces.

__Workforce training providers.__ The [Workforce Almanac](https://www.workforcealmanac.com/), [launched last month](https://www.pw.hks.harvard.edu/post/workforce-almanac-launch) by the Harvard-based [Project on Workforce](https://www.pw.hks.harvard.edu/), maps ‚Äúalmost 17,000 providers of workforce training, which we have defined as short-term (lasting less than two years), post-high school training opportunities in which learners gain work-relevant skills to help them find a job.‚Äù The [dataset](https://www.workforcealmanac.com/explore) lists each organization‚Äôs name, address, city, state, coordinates, and various categorizations. To build it, the team [merged and cleaned data from four sources](https://workforcealmanac.com/methodology): the Department of Labor‚Äôs [Registered Apprenticeship Partners Information Database System](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/data-and-statistics) (RAPIDS) and [TrainingProviderResults.gov](https://www.trainingproviderresults.gov), IRS [nonprofit registrations](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf), and the [Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) (IPEDS).


__Antarctic ice sheets.__ The [Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research](https://scar.org/)‚Äôs [Bedmap Data Portal](https://bedmap.scar.org/) provides access to ‚Äúice bed, surface and thickness point data from all Antarctic geophysical campaigns since the 1950s.‚Äù In [an accompanying paper](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2695/2023/essd-15-2695-2023.html), Alice C. Fr√©mand et al. describe the process they undertook to standardize decades of ice-survey data and to [publish the outputs](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2695/2023/#section5) based on ‚Äú[findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data)‚Äù (FAIR) data principles. In all, the records contain ‚Äú82 million data points collected as part of 277 campaigns,‚Äù spanning three generations of data. __Previously__: [Antarctic geology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02152-9) ([DIP 2023.05.31](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-05-31-edition/)).


__Finance ministers.__ [Brenna Armstrong et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/financial-crises-and-the-selection-and-survival-of-women-finance-ministers/BE5E829CA0838FAEF05B7B7C15E22B32) have compiled a [dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IAEUVB) of 2,900+ people who served as a national finance minister or equivalent position between 1972 and 2017. For each of their 3,200+ tenures, the dataset lists the minister‚Äôs name, country, year-month started/ended, gender, whether the minister received an advanced economics education, and whether they‚Äôd be considered a technocrat ‚Äî i.e., someone who had policy expertise but hadn‚Äôt held elective office.

__Netflix viewership.__ In late 2021, Netflix [began publishing](https://variety.com/vip/netflixs-new-top-10-lists-project-the-illusion-of-transparency-1235113186/) downloadable datasets of [the 10 most popular movies and TV shows each week](https://top10.netflix.com/), overall and by country. Last week the company [published a new data report](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-a-netflix-engagement-report), which lists all 18,000+ titles viewed for 50,000+ hours on the platform in the first half of 2023. The report, which Netflix says it will publish twice a year, indicates each title‚Äôs name, release date, approximate hours viewed, and whether it was available globally.
