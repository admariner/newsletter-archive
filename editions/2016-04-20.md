Data Is Plural — 2016.04.20 edition
===================================

*IP addresses, consumer spending, cricket, clouds, and distilleries.*

&nbsp;

**Where computers (maybe) are.** An under-scrutinized quirk in a little-known, widely-used database “[turned a random Kansas farm into a digital hell](http://fusion.net/story/287592/internet-mapping-glitch-kansas-farm/).” How? [The database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) contains best-guess geographic coordinates for every IP address on the internet. But for millions of IP addresses, the best guess is just *somewhere in the United States*. And, until recently, the database translated that vague location into the latitude and longitude of a farm in Potwin, Kansas. ([Now it points to a lake](http://fusion.net/story/290772/ip-mapping-maxmind-new-us-default-location/).)

**The American consumer.** Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published its [midyear update](http://www.bls.gov/cex/midyear.htm) to the [Consumer Expenditure Survey](http://www.bls.gov/cex/home.htm). The survey collects data on spending, income, and a handful of characteristics about U.S. consumers. One tidbit: On average, Americans are spending approximately 33% of their income on housing, and a tad less than 1% on alcohol.

**Cricket.** Baseball season is in full-swing, basketball and hockey playoffs have begun, and the NFL draft is nigh. No better time to highlight some cricket data! [Cricsheet.org](http://cricsheet.org/) has gathered ball-by-ball data on more than 2,700 matches played since the mid-2000s. Looking for historical data? A [new GitHub repository](https://github.com/dwillis/toss-up) contains stats for more than 40,000 matches going back to [1773](http://www.espncricinfo.com/matches/engine/match/535000.html) (but mostly since the 1970s), [scraped from ESPN Cricinfo](https://github.com/dwillis/python-espncricinfo). **Related:** [How, statistically, the coin toss affects who’ll win](http://www.espncricinfo.com/blogs/content/story/997931.html).

**Where clouds congregate, and when.** Researchers have analyzed 15 years of satellite imagery to create a [nearly-global dataset of seasonal cloud coverage](http://www.earthenv.org/cloud.html). The data — available at a kilometer-square resolution — could help scientists monitor and predict changes in ecosystems.

&nbsp;

**License to distill.** The U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau publishes [a few permit datasets](https://www.ttb.gov/foia/frl.shtml), including [this table of 1,900+ businesses licensed to produce and/or bottle liquor](https://www.ttb.gov/foia/xls/frl-spirits-producers-and-bottlers.htm).
