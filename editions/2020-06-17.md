Data Is Plural — 2020.06.17 edition
===================================

*Confederate monuments, more protest data, the Green Books, sentences for measuring bias, and a few hundred penguins.*

&nbsp;

**Confederate monuments.** For several years, the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/)’s “[Whose Heritage?](https://www.splcenter.org/data-projects/whose-heritage)” project has been gathering and mapping information on “[public symbols of the Confederacy](https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy),” such as monuments, place names, official holidays, commemorative license plates, and municipal seals. For each of the 1,800+ entries, the project’s [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17ps4aqRyaIfpu7KdGsy2HRZaaQiXUfLrpUbaR9yS51E/edit) indicates the type of monument/symbol, its location, sponsor, year dedicated, and (if applicable) year removed.

&nbsp;

**More protest data.** [CountLove.org](https://countlove.org/) has been using news reports to quantify protest events in the US since 2017. Its [downloadable dataset](https://countlove.org/faq.html) currently contains more than 27,000 events and provides each event’s date, location, and approximate number of attendees. The events are also tagged with one or more topics, such as *civil rights*, *healthcare,* *for racial justice*, and *against regulation*. The site’s [search/mapping tool](https://countlove.org/search.html) lets you to filter by those tags, and also for “curated protest data for a more compassionate country.” **Related**: [Tommy Leung](https://www.tommyleung.com/about.htm) and [Nathan Perkins](https://www.nathanntg.com/) [describe how they built the project](https://www.tommyleung.com/countLove/index.htm).

&nbsp;

**The Green Books.** The New York Public Library has digitized [more than 20 volumes of the Green Book](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/the-green-book#/?tab=about) —  a series of travelers’ guides, [published from the 1930s to 1960s by US postal worker Victor Green](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2015/03/24/schomburg-treasures-green-book), that listed hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and other establishments where Black visitors would be safe and welcome. The library has [converted its digital copies into semi-structured text](https://github.com/NYPL-publicdomain/greenbooks) and [turned the 1947 edition into a fully-structured dataset](https://github.com/NYPL-publicdomain/greenbooks/tree/master/geojson). The University of South Carolina has built a [dataset of the 1,500+ listings in the 1956 edition](https://digital.library.sc.edu/collections/the-negro-travelers-green-book-1956/). Inn 2015, NYPL Labs combined both years’ datasets into a [tool to map the locations and plan routes with them](https://publicdomain.nypl.org/greenbook-map/).

&nbsp;

**Sentences for measuring bias.** [StereoSet](https://stereoset.mit.edu/) aims to measure biases toward stereotypes — as they relate to profession, gender, race, and religion — in statistical language models, using [a dataset containing thousands of sentences](https://github.com/moinnadeem/StereoSet), each with several variations. Through the project’s [online data explorer](https://stereoset.mit.edu/explore/dev/), you can examine the sentences and see how some popular language models perform.

**A few hundred penguins.** Data educator [Allison Horst](https://www.allisonhorst.com/) earlier this month [released](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1270046399418138625) a [dataset describing the physical characteristics of 344 Antarctic penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/blob/master/data-raw/penguins_raw.csv), derived from data collected by marine biologist [Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station](https://pal.lternet.edu/). With [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/), Horst aims to provide a data-exploration alternative to the ubiquitous [*iris* dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set), which was first published, in 1936, in the Annals of Eugenics. **Previously**: [Thousands of penguins](http://www.penguinmap.com/mapppd) ([DIP 2020.03.11](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-03-11-edition)).
