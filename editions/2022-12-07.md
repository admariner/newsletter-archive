__Work stoppages.__ The US Bureau of Labor Statistics‚Äô [Work Stoppages](https://www.bls.gov/wsp/home.htm) program [collects](https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/wsp/data.htm) and publishes data on ‚Äúmajor work stoppages involving 1,000 or more workers lasting one full shift or longer.‚Äù The program‚Äôs [main dataset](https://www.bls.gov/web/wkstp/monthly-listing.htm) lists each [major strike or lockout](https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/wsp/concepts.htm) since 1993, the organizations involved, employer industry and ownership type, start and end dates, number of workers participating, and total worker-days idle. Its [annual dataset](https://www.bls.gov/web/wkstp/annual-listing.htm) counts the number of major stoppages, workers involved, and worker-days idle for each year since 1947. __Related__: The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service [used to publish data](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105232710/https://www.fmcs.gov/resources/documents-and-data/#tab-490260b30b23e527b80) on all stoppages that its mediators entered into its case system (regardless of number of workers involved), but stopped doing so in late 2020.

__Avian flu detections.__ The USDA‚Äôs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has been tracking [local cases of avian influenza detected](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai) this year [in commercial and backyard flocks](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-commercial-backyard-flocks), as well as [in wild birds](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-wild-birds) and [in mammals](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-mammals). For each infected flock, the agency‚Äôs public data indicate the flock‚Äôs state, county, producer type, number of birds affected, and confirmation date. The mammal and wild bird data indicate the state, county, date detected, flu strain, and species. __Read more__: ‚Äú[More Than 52 Million Birds in the U.S. Are Dead Because of Avian Flu](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/more-than-52-million-birds-dead-because-of-avian-flu-in-us-180981215/)‚Äù (Smithsonian Magazine).

__Social media suppression.__ Researchers at [Surfshark](https://surfshark.com/about-us) have been monitoring [government-imposed social media shutdowns and restrictions](https://surfshark.com/research/internet-censorship/social-media), drawing on reports from [NetBlocks](https://netblocks.org/), [AccessNow](https://www.accessnow.org/) ([DIP 2021.11.03](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-11-03-edition/)), news publications, and other sources. The [project‚Äôs spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/122netE-cbusPi00GzXqfSvKPjFDxW_9LKeVfPqWyv04/edit#gid=1765756421) highlights each case from 2015 to the present; it lists the country, start/end date, particular services affected (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.), and observed connections to political events (e.g., elections, protests, other turmoil).

__Literature prizewinners.__ [Claire Grossman et al.](https://www.publicbooks.org/who-gets-to-be-a-writer/) have compiled a [dataset](https://view.data.post45.org/mlpwinners) of ‚Äúthe winners and judges of prizes for prose, poetry, or unspecified genre between 1918 and 2020 with a purse of $10,000 and over.‚Äù The 7,100+ entries, shared through the [Post45 Data Collective](https://data.post45.org/), relate to 50 awards and fellowships, plus the Library of Congress‚Äôs poet laureateship. Each entry indicates the prize name, institution, type, genre, year, and dollar amount, plus the winner/judge name, gender, and educational affiliations.

__Video games.__ Developer [Vladimir Belyaev](https://github.com/leinstay) has constructed a [dataset](https://github.com/leinstay/steamdb) representing ‚Äúall games available‚Äù on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/),¬†the massively popular [video game platform and store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_\(service\)). It indicates each game‚Äôs name, price, developer, languages, genre categories, ratings from third-party websites, and more. [h/t [Saul Pwanson](https://www.saul.pw/)]
