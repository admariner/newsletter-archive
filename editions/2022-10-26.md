__Strategic petroleum.__ The US Energy Information Administration maintains a [dataset tracking the monthly volume](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MCSSTUS1&f=M) of the country‚Äôs [Strategic Petroleum Reserve](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/strategic-petroleum-reserve), measured in the thousands of barrels. The figures go back to 1977, [the year the first crude oil was delivered to the reserve](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/spr-quick-facts), but lag by a couple of months; the end-of-August volume is scheduled for publication on October 31. __Read more__: [The Department of Energy‚Äôs history of reserve releases](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/history-spr-releases). __Previously__: [Petroleum Supply Monthly reports](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/monthly/) ([DIP 2017.08.16](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-08-16-edition/)) and [weekly gas prices](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/) ([DIP 2021.06.09](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-06-09-edition/)), both also published by the EIA.

__Internet service offers.__ For an [investigation into speed disparities in internet service offers](https://themarkup.org/still-loading/2022/10/19/dollars-to-megabits-you-may-be-paying-400-times-as-much-as-your-neighbor-for-internet-service), published last week at The Markup, reporters Leon Yin and Aaron Sankin [examined](https://themarkup.org/show-your-work/2022/10/19/how-we-uncovered-disparities-in-internet-deals) more than 1 million address-specific offers across dozens of US cities. To support the findings, they‚Äôve [shared](https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-isp) the raw data gathered from ISPs‚Äô websites, as well as tabular files that summarize each offer and attach the contextual variables used for the analysis. (Disclosure: I served, and am credited, as a ‚ÄúData Coach‚Äù for this project.)


__Boston‚Äôs first women voters.__ The City of Boston‚Äôs [Mary Eliza Project](https://www.boston.gov/departments/archives-and-records-management/mary-eliza-project-boston-women-voters-1920) has been [compiling](https://www.boston.gov/departments/archives-and-records-management/mary-eliza-project-boston-women-voters-1920) a dataset of [women who registered to vote in 1920](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/1920-women-s-voter-register), the year the 19th Amendment granted them that right. The dataset, [transcribed](https://www.boston.gov/news/mary-eliza-project-ward-8-voter-records-now-available) from the original registration books, ‚Äúis updated periodically as additional voter registers are transcribed.‚Äù It contains 6,000+ entries so far, each listing a voter‚Äôs name, registration date, ward, precinct, address, age, country of birth, occupation, husband‚Äôs information, and more.

__Euro-area securities.__ The European Central Bank collects detailed records concerning the [financial instruments issued and held](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/financial_markets_and_interest_rates/securities/html/index.en.html) by organizations and individuals under its jurisdiction. Its quarterly-updated [Securities Holdings Statistics dataset](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/financial_markets_and_interest_rates/securities/html/index.en.html#holdings), [available through the ECB‚Äôs data warehouse](https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/browseSelection.do?node=9700835), aggregates the latter by investor type (bank, non-bank company, pension fund, household, et cetera), investor country of residence, issuer country, type of financial instrument, [and more](https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/browseExplanation.do?node=9700835).

__Gargantuan gourds.__ At [BigPumpkins.com](http://www.bigpumpkins.com/), you can find [annual ‚Äúweigh-off‚Äù results](http://www.bigpumpkins.com/ViewArticle.asp?id=132) from 100+ local competitions affiliated with the [Great Pumpkin Commonwealth](https://gpc1.org/), an international standards-setting organization. Although pumpkins represent the titular attraction, the site also publishes results for the squash, long gourd, watermelon, tomato, field pumpkin, bushel gourd, and marrow competition classes. HTML tables list each specimen‚Äôs weight, grower, location, weigh-off site, and lineage.
