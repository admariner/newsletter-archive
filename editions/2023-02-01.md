*üëã In [last week‚Äôs newsletter](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-01-25-edition/), I noted that the [Coast Guard‚Äôs list of boat recalls](https://uscgboating.org/content/recalls.php) ‚Äúseems possible to scrape.‚Äù Reader [Michael Nolan](https://m-nolan.github.io/) took up the challenge; [here‚Äôs the dataset he extracted](https://github.com/m-nolan/USCG_Boat_Recalls). Thanks, Michael!*


__Women‚Äôs well-being.__ [Camille Belmin et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01824-2)‚Äôs [LivWell dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/7277104) presents ‚Äúa set of key indicators on women‚Äôs socio-economic status, health and well-being, access to basic services and demographic outcomes‚Äù in 447 regions of 52 countries from 1990 to 2019. The indicators include, for example, rates of home ownership, educational attainment, and domestic violence; they‚Äôre based primarily on [data](https://dhsprogram.com/data/) from the [Demographic and Health Surveys Program](https://dhsprogram.com/), a [USAID-funded](https://dhsprogram.com/Who-We-Are/About-Us.cfm) initiative that, since 1984, ‚Äúhas provided technical assistance to more than 400 surveys in over 90 countries, advancing global understanding of health and population trends in developing countries.‚Äù __Read more__: [An introductory Twitter thread from Belmin](https://twitter.com/BelminCamille/status/1597948618220384256).


__Radiation-contaminated waste.__ The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission [regulates the disposal](https://www.nrc.gov/waste/llw-disposal.html) of [‚Äúlow-level‚Äù radioactive waste](https://www.nrc.gov/waste/low-level-waste.html) ‚Äî ‚Äúitems that have become contaminated with radioactive material or have become radioactive through exposure to neutron radiation,‚Äù such as protective equipment and cleaning supplies. The NRC provides [annual statistics](https://www.nrc.gov/waste/llw-disposal/licensing/statistics.html) (facility, volume, and total [curies](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/curie-ci.html)) for the country‚Äôs [four active disposal sites](https://www.nrc.gov/waste/llw-disposal/licensing/locations.html). The Department of Energy‚Äôs [Manifest Information Management System](https://mims.doe.gov/Default.aspx) provides more detailed figures, with breakdowns by month, state of origin, [waste classification](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/waste-classification-classes-of-waste.html), isotope, and more. __Previously__: [Data](https://www.eia.gov/nuclear/spent_fuel/) from the [Nuclear Fuel Data Survey](https://www.eia.gov/Survey/#gc-859) ([DIP 2022.11.23](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-11-23-edition/)).


__Novel dialogue.__ [Krishnapriya Vishnubhotla et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05836)‚Äôs [Project Dialogism Novel Corpus](https://github.com/Priya22/project-dialogism-novel-corpus) contains every quotation from 22 novels, plus who speaks each line, who they‚Äôre addressing, the characters they mention, and more. With 35,000+ quotations, the corpus ‚Äúis by an order of magnitude the largest dataset of annotated quotations for literary texts in English.‚Äù Jane Austen is the most-represented author (five novels), followed by E.M. Forster (two). The researchers have also [published a document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eBsX2rjdLBkmA-kWB_jHCxC1nmbzinH04WUg9PeN_2A/edit) that they ‚Äúhope will help standardize future annotation work in this domain.‚Äù


__Browser capabilities.__ [Alexis Deveria](https://a.deveria.com/)‚Äôs [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) indicates which versions of which web browsers support various web technologies, such as [CSS‚Äôs grid layout](https://caniuse.com/css-grid), the [WebP image format](https://caniuse.com/webp), and the [Image Capture API](https://caniuse.com/imagecapture). The [project‚Äôs dataset](https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse) covers 530+ technologies and 19 browsers (6 desktop, 13 mobile). It also provides estimates of the percentage of all users whose browsers support a given technology. [h/t [Simon Willison](https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@simon/109733835468757632)]


__More English football.__ [Josh Fjelstul](http://www.joshuafjelstul.com/)‚Äôs [English Football Database](https://github.com/jfjelstul/englishfootball) ‚Äúis a comprehensive database of football matches played in the Premier League and the English Football League from the inaugural season of the Football League (1888-89) through the most recent season (2021-22).‚Äù It records each season, team, match, and the standings table at the end of each season. __Previously__: [James P. Curley](http://curleylab.psych.columbia.edu/curley.html)‚Äôs [English soccer dataset](https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata) ([DIP 2016.05.04](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-05-04-edition/)), since expanded to leagues in a dozen more countries.
