__Deportation records.__ The [Deportation Data Project](https://deportationdata.org/), run by a [team of academics and lawyers](https://deportationdata.org/team.html), ‚Äúcollects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets.‚Äù These [include data](https://deportationdata.org/data.html) from border apprehensions, deportations, [Title 42 expulsions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_42_expulsion), ICE arrests and detentions, ICE-operated flights, and more. Some of the data files come directly from the government, while others were initially obtained from the government by other organizations, such as the [University of Washington Center for Human Rights](https://github.com/UWCHR). The project also [posts information about its Freedom of Information Act requests](https://deportationdata.org/foia.html). __Read more__: The project‚Äôs ‚Äú[U.S. Immigration Enforcement Data: A Short Guide](https://deportationdata.org/guide.html).‚Äù __As seen in__: ‚Äú[The Rising Cost of ICE Flying Immigrants to Far-Flung Detention Centers](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-trump-ice-immigrant-move-costs-taxpayers/)‚Äù (Bloomberg).

__European workforces.__ Each quarter, dozens of countries collectively conduct [more than 1.7 million interviews](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/lfs/information-data) for the [European Union Labour Force Survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/lfs). The survey, the continent‚Äôs largest, aims ‚Äúto classify people into 3 groups that are mutually exclusive and cover the whole target population‚Äù: employed, unemployed, and outside the labor force. Eurostat publishes [aggregate results](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/lfs/database), with breakdowns by age, sex, country, nationality, citizenship status, education level, sector, and more. Detailed microdata are also [available to approved researchers](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/microdata). __As seen in__: [Bruegel‚Äôs labor market dashboard](https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/eu-labour-market-outlook-dashboard).

__California ghost guns.__ ‚ÄúGhost guns have been a [uniquely Californian issue](https://www.thetrace.org/2024/11/ghost-guns-decline-regulation-biden-atf/),‚Äù with the state accounting for a majority of the untraceable firearms that are reported to the [ATF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives), according to [The Trace](https://www.thetrace.org/). Earlier this year, on its [Gun Violence Data Hub](https://datahub.thetrace.org/), the publication [posted datasets counting the ghost guns recovered](https://datahub.thetrace.org/dataset/california-ghost-guns-stolen-guns-and-more/) by California law enforcement agencies, as well as ‚Äúfirearm-level data on guns reported lost or stolen in the state.‚Äù [h/t [Aaron Mendelson](https://bsky.app/profile/amendelson.bsky.social)]


__US dams.__ The [National Inventory of Dams](https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/#/) ‚Äúdocuments all known dams in the U.S. and its territories that meet certain criteria‚Äù [related](https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/#/about-the-nid/mission) to the dam‚Äôs height, reservoir size, and likely impacts of its ‚Äúfailure or mis-operation.‚Äù The inventory, maintained by the US Army Corps of Engineers since the 1970s, now includes 92,000+ structures. The data ‚Äî available via a [searchable map](https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/#/dams/search/&viewType=map&resultsType=dams&advanced=false&hideList=false&eventSystem=false), [bulk downloads](https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/#/downloads), and an [API](https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/api/developer) ‚Äî indicate each dam‚Äôs name, location, year built, structural characteristics, purpose, operational status, and much more. __Previously__: [Global Dam Watch‚Äôs datasets](https://www.globaldamwatch.org/database) ([DIP 2020.01.29](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-01-29-edition/)) and the USGS‚Äôs [National Hydrography Dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset) ([DIP 2022.10.12](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-10-12-edition/)).


__What the nose knows.__ [Antonie Louise Bierling et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04644-2) have [published a dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/14727277) of ‚Äúdescriptions, evaluative ratings, and qualitative labels for 74 chemically diverse mono-molecular odors, rated by a large sample of young adults.‚Äù [Another paper by Bierling et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04630-8) ‚Äúelicited body odor descriptions from 2,607 participants across 17 countries and 13 languages‚Äù to assemble ‚Äú[a standardized lexicon of body odor words](https://osf.io/rpzjk/).‚Äù __Related__: The [Pyrfume Project](https://pyrfume.org/) provides ‚Äútools, models, and data for odorant-linked research.‚Äù
