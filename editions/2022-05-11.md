*Drugs for rare diseases, LGBTQI+ elected officials, tornadoes, mask-wearing on NYC transit, and Milwaukee house styles.*


__Drugs for rare diseases.__ The US [Orphan Drug Act of 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_Drug_Act_of_1983) provided [incentives for pharmaceutical companies](https://www.fda.gov/industry/orphan-products-development-events/story-behind-orphan-drug-act) to develop treatments for [rare diseases](https://www.fda.gov/patients/rare-diseases-fda). The Food and Drug Administration [reviews applications](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/office-clinical-policy-and-programs/office-orphan-products-development) for treatments seeking this “orphan” status, decides whether to designate them as such, and maintains a [database of all 6,000+ designations since 1983](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/). The database lists each treatment’s generic name, trade name (if any), “sponsor” company, designated use(s), date(s) of designation, and whether/when the FDA approved it for sale. __Previously__: [Rare disease data from Orphanet](https://www.orpha.net/) ([DIP 2022.04.20](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-04-20-edition/)) and [the FDA’s “Orange Book” of drug approvals](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/approved-drug-products-therapeutic-equivalence-evaluations-orange-book) ([DIP 2017.03.08](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-03-08-edition/)).

__LGBTQI+ elected officials.__ The [Queer Politics at Princeton](https://queerpolitics.princeton.edu/) research program [has assembled](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2022/04/25/new-scholarly-database-publicly-identifying-lgbtqi-elected-officials-across-globe) an [international map and database](https://queerpolitics.princeton.edu/data) of 1,000+ officials elected since the 1970s “who publicly identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, transgender, non-binary, gender-non-conforming, queer or intersex.” The project focuses on candidates elected to national, state, and mayoral offices. Entries indicate each official’s name, country, party affiliation, level of government, position held, year first elected, sexual and gender identity, whether they were out when first elected, the year they came out, and more.

__Tornadoes.__ Although the [primary mission](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/aboutus.html) of the National Weather Service’s [Storm Prediction Center](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/) is forward-looking, the center also [provides historical maps, charts, and datasets](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/). Among them: the Severe Weather Database, which contains all tornado reports for the contiguous US from 1950 to 2020, plus major hail storms and “damaging wind” events since 1955. It lists each incident’s date, starting and ending locations, intensity, injury count, fatality count, property loss, and more.

__Mask-wearing on NYC transit.__ Since June 2020, New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority has surveyed mask usage in a sample of subways and at its busiest bus stops. The results, available to [view](https://new.mta.info/safety-and-security/nyct-mask-compliance) and [download](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-and-Bus-Mask-Compliance-Statistics-Begi/ijxr-nffj), indicate the number of people observed (nearly 5 million so far) during each biweekly survey cycle and the percentages of them found to be wearing a mask correctly, incorrectly, or not at all.

__Milwaukee house styles.__ Milwaukee’s [Master Property File](https://data.milwaukee.gov/dataset/mprop), first assembled in 1975, “contains more than 90 elements of data describing each of the approximately 160,000 properties in the city.” The elements include each home’s city-assessed architectural style — Tudor, for instance, or Cape Cod, or bungalow. __As seen in__: [This story-map by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel](https://www.jsonline.com/in-depth/news/local/2022/03/31/milwaukee-home-styles-architecture-reveal-citys-history-bungalows-craftsman-duplex/6835671001/), based on [an analysis](https://github.com/jdjohn215/milwaukee-house-styles) by [John D. Johnson](https://johndjohnson.info/). [h/t [Rose Mintzer-Sweeney](https://blog.datawrapper.de/data-vis-dispatch-april-5-2022/)]
