Data Is Plural — 2017.04.19 edition
===================================

*Prescriptions, vaccinations, cyclones, plant hardiness zones, and spelling self-corrections.*


__UK, US, Rx.__ The UK’s National Health Service publishes [monthly data on drugs prescribed in England](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/prescribing-by-gp-practice-presentation-level) through the country’s single-payer health care system. (Drugs prescribed in Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland aren’t included.) For each prescriber-and-drug combination, the dataset includes the quantity and cost of prescriptions for each month since August 2010. The US publishes similar data about [prescriptions issued through Medicare](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Part-D-Prescriber.html), but only on an annual basis and currently only covering 2013 and 2014. __Related:__ ProPublica’s [Prescriber Checkup](https://projects.propublica.org/checkup/), which uses the Medicare data to examine doctors’ prescribing patterns. __Previously:__ [A decade-plus of Australian prescription data](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-08-24-edition) (DIP 2016.08.24).

__Vaccination rates by state.__ The CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases collects and publishes state-by-state vaccination rates for [infants](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/childvaxview/data-reports/index.html), [kindergartners](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/schoolvaxview/data-reports/index.html), [teens](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/teenvaxview/data-reports/index.html), and [adults](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/adultvaxview/data-reports/index.html) — plus, [flu vaccination rates](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/interactive.htm) for several age groups. Each dataset includes several years’ worth of data, with many going back to 2008 or 2009. __Related:__ “[California Shows The Rest Of The Country How To Boost Kindergarten Vaccination Rates](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/record-vaccination-in-california),” by my colleague [Peter Aldhous](http://www.peteraldhous.com/), with additional [county-level data from the Golden State](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/immunize/Pages/ImmunizationLevels.aspx). __Previously:__ [International vaccination rates and policies](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-08-03-edition) (DIP 2016.08.03).


__Tropical cyclones.__ Through its [International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/) project, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration publishes what it calls “[the most complete global set of historical tropical cyclones available](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=ibtracs-data).” For each tropical cyclone — a category that includes typhoons, hurricanes, tropical depressions, and more — the dataset includes its position, wind speed, central pressure, and classification at six-hour intervals. The dataset is updated annually and includes some historical cyclones from as early as 1842. [h/t [Daniel Miller](https://opendata.stackexchange.com/a/10994)]


__Where plants grow best.__ The [USDA’s Plant Hardiness Zone Map](http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Default.aspx) “is the standard by which gardeners and growers can determine which plants are most likely to thrive at a location.” The USDA and Oregon State, which have jointly developed the map, previously [sold access to the underlying data](http://web.archive.org/web/20151001025259/http://climatesource.com/cgi-bin/csshop/scan/st=db/co=yes/sf=category/se=phz_us_phz/op=eq/va=banner_text=US%20%28grids%20%26%20shapefiles%29.html) through a vendor. But after the vendor shut down earlier this year, OSU began [publishing the data free of charge](http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/projects/plant_hardiness_zones.php) (though with some licensing restrictions). The dataset is available as detailed shapefiles and as ZIP code–based spreadsheets.

__Spelling self-corrections.__ For a [2012 academic paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2390665.2390749), researchers captured the keystrokes of paid volunteers as they typed descriptions of images. Whenever a participant used the backspace key to correct a word, the researchers added it to [a dataset of self-corrections](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52418). Each of the 44,000 lines in the English-language version of the dataset contains the original mistake and the correction. The most common change was *in* → *on*. Other common fixes included *waling → walking* and *pople → people*. [h/t [Seth Stephens-Davidowitz](http://sethsd.com/everybodylies/)]
