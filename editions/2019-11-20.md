Data Is Plural — 2019.11.20 edition
===================================

*Chicago prosecutions, electricity prices, financial well-being, soccer play-by-play, and Central Park squirrels.*

&nbsp;

**Chicago prosecutions.** Since early 2018, the [Cook County State's Attorney's Office](https://www.cookcountystatesattorney.org/) has been publishing [detailed data](https://www.cookcountystatesattorney.org/about/case-level-data) on every felony case it has handled since 2010. (The office, whose jurisdiction includes Chicago, is the second-largest local prosecutorial agency in the country.) [The datasets](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/browse?tags=state%27s+attorney+case-level&sortBy=most_accessed) cover four main stages: [intake](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Courts/Intake/3k7z-hchi), [initiation](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Courts/Initiation/7mck-ehwz), [charging](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Courts/Dispositions/apwk-dzx8), and [sentencing](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Courts/Sentencing/tg8v-tm6u). **Related:** In a [recent Pudding article](https://pudding.cool/2019/10/prosecutors/) copublished with [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/10/24/the-kim-foxx-effect-how-prosecutions-have-changed-in-cook-county) and [Chicago Reporter](https://projects.chicagoreporter.com/kim-foxx-prosecutions-20191024/), [Matt Daniels](https://twitter.com/matthew_daniels) used the data to examine how prosecutions have changed under State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, who promised reforms.

&nbsp;

**Electricity prices.** OpenEI’s [Utility Rate Database](https://openei.org/wiki/Utility_Rate_Database) contains nearly 50,000 expert-verified rates — current and historical — for residential, commercial, industrial, and street-lighting electricity from thousands of US utility companies. **Related:** [OpenEI’s other data offerings](https://openei.org/wiki/Data).

**Financial well-being.** Since the mid-1980s, the US Census Bureau has periodically conducted its [Survey of Income and Program Participation](https://www.census.gov/sipp/) and provided [anonymized, respondent-level data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/data/datasets.html). In addition to the titular topics, the [extensive questionnaires](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/about/sipp-content-information.html) also ask about “family dynamics, educational attainment, housing expenditures, asset ownership, health insurance, disability, child care, and food security.” **Related:** My colleagues [Scott Pham](https://twitter.com/scottpham) and [Venessa Wong](https://twitter.com/venessawwong) [used SIPP’s data on familial support](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2019-11-sipp) to “[finally end the myth of the lazy millennial](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessawong/millennials-parents-stereotypes-boomers-data).”

&nbsp;

**Soccer/football play-by-play.** A group of academics has partnered with a soccer-data company [to publish](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0247-7) what they believe to be “the largest collection of soccer-logs ever released.” [The dataset](https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000) describes every “event” on the field — each pass, shot, foul, tackle, penalty, and more — for the 2017/18 season of five European leagues, the 2018 World Cup, and the 2016 European championship.

&nbsp;

**Central Park squirrels.** Last October, the [Squirrel Census](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) dispatched 300+ volunteers to record every squirrel they saw in Central Park. In June, the organizers published a multimedia report of their findings ([at $75 each](https://squirrelcensus.bigcartel.com/product/central-park-squirrel-census-2019-report)). Now they’ve made the data — with each squirrel’s location, fur color, behavior, and more — [available through New York City’s open data portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw). **Related:** [CityLab has more details on the project and interviews its creator](https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/06/squirrel-census-results-population-central-park-nyc/592162/).
