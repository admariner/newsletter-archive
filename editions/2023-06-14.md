__Canadian wildfires.__ The [Canadian Wildland Fire Information System](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/home) monitors wildfires and fire-conducive conditions across the country. It publishes daily maps of its [Fire Weather Index](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/maps/fw?type=fwi), [satellite-detected hotspots](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/maps/fm3?type=tri), and [fire intensity predictions](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/maps/fb), among other analyses. Its [Canadian National Fire Database](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/ha/nfdb) provides the perimeters, dates, sizes, and other metadata for tens of thousands of fires, spanning decades. In the [agency‚Äôs datamart](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart), you can find additional downloads of tabular and geospatial data, including [burned-area statistics](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart/metadata/nbac), [active fires](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart/metadata/activefires), and current conditions. __Related__: The [Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre](https://www.ciffc.ca/)‚Äôs [dashboard of active fires](https://ciffc.net/). __Previously__: The [Global Wildfire Information System](https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/) ([DIP 2022.07.27](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-07-27-edition/)).

__Climate finance.__ ‚ÄúRich nations say they‚Äôre spending billions to fight climate change‚Äù in developing countries, notes a [recent Reuters investigation](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-finance/), which found some of this climate finance [going to ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù projects](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CLIMATE-CHANGE/FINANCE/gdvzqlyjqpw/), ‚Äúincluding a coal plant, a hotel and chocolate shops.‚Äù To help find those examples, Reuters teamed up with [Big Local News](https://biglocalnews.org/content/about/) to [extract](https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:dx902xg3463/README_bln_reuters_climate_finance.pdf) ‚Äú43,844 records [from the] [Fifth](https://unfccc.int/BR5), [Fourth](https://unfccc.int/BR4), and [Third](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/transparency-and-reporting/reporting-and-review-under-the-convention/national-communications-and-biennial-reports-annex-i-parties/biennial-report-submissions/third-biennial-reports-annex-i) Biennial reports that developed countries submitted to the U.N. Climate Change secretariat.‚Äù Each of [the records](https://purl.stanford.edu/dx902xg3463) represents a reported contribution, listing the recipient country/region, program funded, funding amount, sector, status, and more. __Read more__: ‚Äú[How you can use climate finance data we collected for local stories around the globe](https://biglocalnews.org/content/news/2023/06/01/climate-finance-story-recipe.html)‚Äù (Big Local News).


__Pennsylvania competency cases.__ Earlier this year, [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/) and the [Pittsburgh Institute for Nonprofit Journalism](https://pinjnews.org/) published an [investigation](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/03/pa-mental-illness-jail-incompetent-treatment/) into Pennsylvania‚Äôs competency system, which is ‚Äúsupposed to protect people with mental health issues from prosecution if they cannot understand the legal system and cannot aid in their own defense.‚Äù The team has also published the [data it received from the state‚Äôs court administrators](https://github.com/spotlightpa/competency-data-2023/), with information about 697 cases that involved competency proceedings between 2018 to mid-2022. The records, available for 23 counties, indicate each case‚Äôs court, filing date, charges, disposition, sentencing, attorneys, plus the type and timing of 1,400+ competency-related docket filings.

__Ad-targeting labels.__ [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/) has [obtained, analyzed, and published](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2023/06/08/from-heavy-purchasers-of-pregnancy-tests-to-the-depression-prone-we-found-650000-ways-advertisers-label-you) a [spreadsheet of 650,000+ ad-targetable ‚Äúaudience segments‚Äù](https://github.com/the-markup/xandr-audience-segments) (described by labels such as ‚ÄúDepression Propensity - Reach Tier 2‚Äù) and their data suppliers. The spreadsheet ‚Äî¬†flagged to The Markup by privacy researcher [Wolfie Christl](https://wolfie.crackedlabs.org/en) ‚Äî¬†was, until recently, linked from the website of a Microsoft-owned ad platform. ‚ÄúThe Markup found thousands of rows in the file that indicate sensitive audience groupings,‚Äù including those related to medical issues, race/ethnicity, political activity, addiction, and more.

__Food defect thresholds.__ ‚ÄúHow many rat hairs in your macaroni before the FDA considers it adulterated?‚Äù asks [Cody Winchester](https://codywinchester.com/), who has found the answer in the Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs [Food Defect Levels Handbook](https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredients-additives-gras-packaging-guidance-documents-regulatory-information/food-defect-levels-handbook). That guide‚Äôs ‚Äúaction levels‚Äù table lists 180 criteria for 111 commodities, indicating the ‚Äúmaximum levels of natural or unavoidable defects in foods for human use that present no health hazard.‚Äù Winchester has [converted the table into a JSON file](https://github.com/cjwinchester/fda-food-defect-action-levels). __The answer__: An ‚Äúaverage of 4.5 rodent hairs or more per 225 grams in 6 or more subsamples.‚Äù
