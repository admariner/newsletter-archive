Data Is Plural — 2021.02.03 edition
===================================

*Private prisons, detailed elevations, even more mortality data, web trackers, and hockey.*


__Private prisons.__ Political scientist [Anna Gunderson](https://www.annagunderson.com/home) has [assembled](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/why-do-states-privatize-their-prisons-the-unintended-consequences-of-inmate-litigation/AF814E16A605CA894D558AE72BEF65C9) a [longitudinal dataset of private prisons](https://www.annagunderson.com/data/private-prisons) at the federal, state, and local level through 2016. Using decades of financial reports by the two largest operators, plus those by two other companies one later acquired, Gunderson’s dataset identifies each facility’s name, location, primary customer, capacity, security level, contract information, and more. __Related__: Last week, President Biden [signed an executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/executive-order-reforming-our-incarceration-system-to-eliminate-the-use-of-privately-operated-criminal-detention-facilities/) to phase out the federal use of such facilities.


__Detailed elevations.__ Among [its goals](https://opentopography.org/about), [OpenTopography](https://opentopography.org/) wants to “democratize online access to high-resolution (meter to sub-meter scale), Earth science-oriented, topography data acquired with lidar and other technologies.” The project hosts [hundreds of elevation datasets](https://portal.opentopography.org/dataCatalog) from [around the world](https://portal.opentopography.org/datasets), available to visualize online and to download. __Related__: The US Geological Survey’s [3D Elevation Program](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep/what-is-3dep) aims “to provide the first-ever national baseline of consistent high-resolution topographic elevation data” by 2023, and already publishes [a range of subnational datasets](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep/data-tools).

__Even more mortality data.__ The [World Mortality Dataset](https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality) contains recent “all-cause mortality” counts for 79 countries, aggregated to weekly, monthly, or quarterly totals (depending on availability). Launched last week by researchers [Ariel Karlinsky](https://akarlinsky.github.io/) and [Dmitry Kobak](https://dkobak.github.io/), the project draws on the [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/), [EuroStat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Weekly_death_statistics&stable), and data [collected by the New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/excess-deaths) ([DIP 2020.05.27](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-05-27-edition)); and [expands upon it](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250604v1) by gathering data from government websites and through direct inquiries.

__Web trackers.__ DuckDuckGo’s [Tracker Radar](https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/) watches the web’s watchers. The regularly-updated [dataset](https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-radar) currently covers 36,000+ of the most common third-party domains, and provides “detailed information about their tracking behavior, including prevalence, ownership, fingerprinting behavior, cookie behavior, privacy policy,” and more. __As seen in__: [Blacklight](https://themarkup.org/blacklight), The Markup’s “real-time website privacy inspector,” which [uses the dataset](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/how-we-built-a-real-time-privacy-inspector).

__Hockey.__ The National Hockey League [has an undocumented API](https://www.kevinsidwar.com/iot/2017/7/1/the-undocumented-nhl-stats-api). Technologist [Drew Hynes](https://pure-defect.com/about/) is [making sense of the dozens of endpoints](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi), which provide data on decades of player stats, game schedules, draft picks, and more.
