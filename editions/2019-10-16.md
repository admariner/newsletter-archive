Data Is Plural — 2019.10.16 edition
===================================

*Presidential popularity, California power outages, mobile broadband prices, the ways couples meet, and palm trees.*


__Presidential popularity.__ The [Executive Approval Project](http://www.executiveapproval.org/) uses international polling data measure public support for presidents, prime ministers, and other political executives in 50 countries. For most of the countries, the database goes back to the 1990s; for some, it goes even further. Access requires providing a name, affiliation, and email address — plus agreeing to receive updates.

__California power outages.__ Last week, Pacific Gas and Electric began [cutting power to hundreds of thousands of Californians](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-10/pg-e-california-power-outages-grid-climate-change) — a precaution to keep the company’s aging infrastructure from sparking wildfires. [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) [has been scraping](https://simonwillison.net/2019/Oct/10/pge-outages/) PG&E’s [outage website](http://critweb-outage.pgealerts.com/?WT.mc_id=Vanity_pge-outages) every 10 minutes, and pushing the results into a [database you can query and download](https://pge-outages.simonwillison.net/pge-outages).

__Mobile broadband prices.__ Since 2017, the [Alliance for Affordable Internet](https://a4ai.org/who-we-are/) has been collecting [country-level prices for mobile data](https://a4ai.org/mobile-broadband-pricing-data-historical/). The [most recent data](https://a4ai.org/extra/mobile_broadband_pricing_usd-2019Q2) covers 99 low- and middle-income countries for the second quarter of 2019. The rates are based on “the cheapest plan(s) providing at least 1GB of broadband data over a 30-day period from the largest mobile network operator in each country.” [h/t [Teddy Woodhouse](https://twitter.com/TeddyWoodhouse)]


__Dating.__ Stanford’s [How Couples Meet and Stay Together](https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst) study, which receives funding from both the university and the National Science Foundation, has been asking American adults about dating since 2009. A [new-and-updated version of the survey](https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst2017) includes questions related to dating apps.

__🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴.__ A team of researchers has “[derived measurements of essential functional traits](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0189-0)” for more than 2,500 species of palm plants — including but not limited to palm trees. Their [PalmTraits database](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.ts45225), based on published studies and preserved specimens, includes variables such as maximum height, fruit shape, and whether the fruit color is “conspicuous.”
