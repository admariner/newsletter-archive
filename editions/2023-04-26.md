*Drinking water violations, childcare prices, kinship terms, art history allocations, and ‚Äúthe oldest experimental crop field in America.‚Äù*


*üì¨ Reader [Robin Moffatt](https://data-folks.masto.host/@rmoff) used the [drone registration data Ben Welsh obtained via FOIA](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/database-of-14-cfr-part-48-registered-drones-132943/) ([DIP 2022.12.21](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-12-21-edition/)) in a [blog post demonstrating lakeFS‚Äô role-based access controls](https://lakefs.io/blog/security-in-lakefs-understanding-role-based-access-control-rbac).

__Drinking water violations.__ Through the [Safe Drinking Water Act](https://www.epa.gov/sdwa), the US Environmental Protection Agency sets baseline standards for the country‚Äôs [~150,000 public water systems](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/information-about-public-water-systems). Although enforcement is [mostly delegated to the states and territories](https://echo.epa.gov/help/sdwa-faqs), all monitoring, violation, and enforcement data is reported to the EPA and stored in its [Safe Drinking Water Information System](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sdwis-overview). The agency provides [bulk downloads](https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads#dwdownloads) of [the data](https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads/sdwa-download-summary), going back decades, plus a [search tool](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sdwis-search) and [dashboard](https://echo.epa.gov/trends/comparative-maps-dashboards/drinking-water-dashboard?state=National). __As seen in__: ‚Äú[Which cities have health issues with their drinking water?](https://usafacts.org/articles/which-cities-have-health-issues-with-their-drinking-water/)‚Äù (USAFacts). __Related__: [Sara Hughes et al.](https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000081)‚Äôs [Municipal Drinking Water Database](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DFB6NG), which connects information about 2,000+ municipal water systems to local demographic, government, climate, and political indicators.

__Childcare prices.__ The [National Database of Childcare Prices](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/topics/featured-childcare), launched [in January](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/wb/wb20230124) by the Department of Labor‚Äôs [Women‚Äôs Bureau](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb), ‚Äúis the most comprehensive federal source of childcare prices at the county level.‚Äù For each county and year from 2008 to 2018, the dataset provides estimates of the median and 75th-percentile weekly cost, disaggregated by provider type and child age. The estimates are [calculated from the market surveys](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WB/media/NationalDatabaseofChildcarePricesTechnicalGuideFinal.pdf) the federal Child Care and Development Fund [requires participating states to conduct](https://childcareta.acf.hhs.gov/equal-access-and-market-rate-surveys).

__Kinship terms.__ [Kinbank](http://www.kinbank.net/) is a browseable and [downloadable](https://github.com/kinbank/kinbank) database of family-tree nomenclature for [1,000+ spoken languages](http://www.kinbank.net/languages/), across 100+ types of relationships. Examples include *ah√§tatum* ([Akkadian](http://www.kinbank.net/languages/akka1240/) for one‚Äôs younger sister), *yerud√™* ([Galibi Carib](http://www.kinbank.net/languages/gali1262/) for one‚Äôs husband‚Äôs brother‚Äôs wife), and *…óan‚Äô√πbƒÅ* ([Hausa](http://www.kinbank.net/languages/haus1257/) for one‚Äôs paternal half-brother). As the [project‚Äôs team](https://excd.org/research-activities/kinbank/) describes in a [recent paper](https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/157986/), they‚Äôve collected these ‚Äúkinship terminologies‚Äù mostly from secondary sources, which ‚Äúranged from ethnographies and grammars, to simpler descriptions like wordlists‚Äù; those sources ‚Äúare primarily in Roman script [‚Ä¶] and can contain transcription inconsistencies across languages.‚Äù


__Art history allocations.__ For her undergraduate thesis, ‚Äú[Quantifying Art Historical Narratives](https://github.com/hollandstam1/thesis/blob/main/_book/Quantifying-Art-Historical-Narratives.pdf),‚Äù Holland Stam measured the amount of space (in text and in images) devoted to each artwork and artist in 25 editions of two major art history textbooks: [*Gardner‚Äôs Art Through the Ages*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardner%27s_Art_Through_the_Ages) and [*Janson‚Äôs History of Art*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/373059219). Stam‚Äôs [thesis repository](https://github.com/hollandstam1/thesis) includes [the measurement data](https://github.com/hollandstam1/thesis/tree/main/raw-data), which also indicates each artist‚Äôs nationality, gender, race, and ethnicity. __Related__: [An R package for the data](https://saralemus7.github.io/arthistory/). __As seen in__: ‚Äú[Resampling to understand gender in #TidyTuesday art history data](https://juliasilge.com/blog/art-history/),‚Äù a post and screencast by [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/).


__The Morrow Plots.__ The University of Illinois‚Äô [Morrow Plots](https://aces.illinois.edu/research/history/morrow-plots), established in 1876, ‚Äúare the oldest experimental crop field in America and the second oldest in the world.‚Äù An [interdisciplinary team](https://aces.illinois.edu/news/oldest-us-agricultural-plots-go-digital-130-years-data-now-online) has [compiled, cleaned, and standardized](https://github.com/SandiCal/morrow-plots-public) the experiment‚Äôs archival records (such as [this notebook](https://digital.library.illinois.edu/collections/259e2e70-3ed0-0138-717e-02d0d7bfd6e4-3)). For each year and plot, their [dataset](https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-7865141) lists the crop, date of planting, treatment plan, amount of various substances applied, yield per acre, and more.
