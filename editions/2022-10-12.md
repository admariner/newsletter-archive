*Work-related injury counts, US hydrography, rebel leaders, file formats, and wine economics.*


__Work-related injury counts.__ The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration [requires many](https://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping) ([but not all](https://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/presentations/exempttable)) businesses to [track employees’ work-related injuries and illnesses](https://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/forms). Larger companies and those in high-risk industries must [electronically submit annual counts](https://www.osha.gov/injuryreporting/) to the agency. Thanks to freedom-of-information lawsuits by [Reveal](https://revealnews.org/blog/federal-judge-sides-with-reveal-ruling-injury-and-illness-data-is-public/) and [Public Citizen](https://www.citizen.org/litigation/public-citizen-foundation-v-department-of-labor-osha-form-300a-records/), OSHA [began](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20200904) to publish [business-level data from those electronic submissions](https://www.osha.gov/Establishment-Specific-Injury-and-Illness-Data) in 2020. The records, which go back to 2016, include each business’s name, location, industry, employee count, and employee hours worked, plus their reported number of deaths, injuries, skin disorders, respiratory conditions, poisonings, hearing loss, and other illnesses.


__US hydrography.__ The [National Hydrography Dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset), maintained by the US Geological Survey, “represents the water drainage network of the United States with features such as rivers, streams, canals, lakes, ponds, coastline, dams, and streamgages.” You can [download](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/access-national-hydrography-products) the NHD geospatial files by [hydrologic unit](https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html) or state, or for the entire nation. __Related__: [A dataset of waterfalls and rapids in the contiguous US](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e8d2b5982cee42d13466001), linked to the NHD and sourced partly from [Bryan Swan and Dean Goss](https://www.worldwaterfalldatabase.com/about)’s [World Waterfall Database](https://www.worldwaterfalldatabase.com/).

__Rebel leaders.__ [Benjamin Acosta et al.](https://www.rebelleaders.org/publications-research)’s [Rebel Organization Leaders Database](https://www.rebelleaders.org/) “provides a wide range of biographical information on all top rebel, insurgent, and terrorist leaders who were active in civil wars between 1980 and 2011.” It includes each leader’s name, gender, education, religion, languages spoken, number of children, years in role, country fought against, cause of death, and [much more](https://www.rebelleaders.org/download). The database covers 425 individuals fighting against 80+ countries; the project also features [written profiles for a sample of them](https://www.rebelleaders.org/leader-profile-examples).


__File formats.__ The US National Archives’ [Digital Preservation Framework](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/digital-preservation/risk) describes the agency’s [risk assessments](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/digital-preservation/tree/master/Digital_Preservation_Risk_Matrix) and [recommended preservation plans](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/digital-preservation/tree/master/Digital_Preservation_Plan_Spreadsheet) for 600+ file formats. The [framework’s documentation](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/digital-preservation) places each format into one of 16 categories, such as “digital audio,” “spreadsheets,” “navigational charts,” and “software and code.” In August, the agency added [“linked open data” representations](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/digital-preservation/linked-data) of the [plans for each format](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/digital-preservation/linked-data/browse).

__Wine economics.__ Researchers at the University of Adelaide’s [Wine Economics Research Centre](https://economics.adelaide.edu.au/wine-economics/) have compiled [several longitudinal datasets](https://economics.adelaide.edu.au/wine-economics/databases). One, for example, quantifies the [total area devoted to growing each grape variety in each country](https://economics.adelaide.edu.au/wine-economics/databases#database-of-regional-national-and-global-winegrape-bearing-areas-by-variety-1960-to-2016), 1960–2016. Another compiles [various market statistics](https://economics.adelaide.edu.au/wine-economics/databases#annual-database-of-global-wine-markets-1835-to-2019) (e.g., national wine production, imports, exports) going back to 1835. __Related__: The [International Organisation of Vine and Wine](https://www.oiv.int/) maintains a [database of global and national statistics](https://www.oiv.int/en/statistiques/recherche) going back to 1995. __As seen in__: [Jack Zhao’s exploration of the Adelaide data](https://blog.smallmultiples.com.au/2020/12/09/the-origins-and-production-of-wine-grapes/).
