Data Is Plural — 2022.09.21 edition
===================================

*Labor turnover, biodiversity trends, probabilistic predictions, working artists, and Atari emails.*


__Labor turnover.__ The US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly [Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/) estimates the number of jobs that people quit, how many people were fired or laid off, the number of new hires, and the current number of open positions. Those estimates, based on data [gathered from a sample of businesses across the country](https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/jlt/data.htm), are available to [download and query](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/data.htm) by state, industry, and business size. They [include most types of workers](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/jltdef.htm), regardless of whether they’re full-time or part-time, permanent or seasonal, salaried or hourly.


__Biodiversity trends.__ [Maria Dornelas et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12729)’s [BioTIME](https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/) project has collected and standardized data from hundreds of studies examining ecological communities over time. You can [browse and search the studies](https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/download.php) by year, taxa, species, and biome. You can also [download the full dataset](https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/downloadFull.php), which provides information about each study (biome, start/end years, number of species tallied, and much more) and each sample collected (date, location, species, abundance, and biomass). __As seen in__: “[Economic Production and Biodiversity in the United States](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qy76a/),” by Yuanning Liang et al.


__Probabilistic predictions.__ [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/about/) is a forecasting platform whose community has registered [more than 1 million predictions](https://twitter.com/fianxu/status/1569537658103431168) on questions such as “[Will a major nuclear power plant in Germany be operational on June 1, 2023?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/10004/german-nuclear-power/)” The [website’s API](https://www.metaculus.com/api2/) provides data on [questions posed](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/), [user rankings](https://www.metaculus.com/rankings/), and other aspects of the platform. For each question, you can see its phrasing, date posed, creator, prediction type, the distribution of predictions, and more. __Related__: [Zoltar](https://zoltardata.com/), a forecast archive assembled by [Nicholas G. Reich et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00839-5). __Previously__: [FiveThirtyEight’s assessment of its own predictions](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/checking-our-work/) ([DIP 2019.04.10](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-04-10-edition/)).


__Working artists.__ The [National Endowment for the Arts](https://www.arts.gov/about) regularly produces [statistical profiles of the arts in the United States](https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/arts-data-profile-series). The latest, “[Artists in the Workforce: National and State Estimates for 2015-2019](https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/arts-data-profile-series/adp-31),” is tabulated from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. It [provides](https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/arts-data-profile-series/adp-31/data-tables) employment and earning estimates by artistic occupation and demographic. Additional tabulations, including for the country’s 25 largest metro areas, are [available](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NADAC/studies/38389/summary) through the [National Archive of Data on Arts and Culture](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NADAC/index.html). [h/t [Gary Price](https://www.infodocket.com/2022/08/31/new-data-alert-labor-force-estimates-for-artist-occupations/)]


__Atari emails.__ A couple of decades ago, [Jed Margolin](https://www.jmargolin.com/) posted a [cache of electronic mail messages](https://www.jmargolin.com/vmail/vmail.htm) from his time as a video game hardware engineer at Atari (and Atari Games, a successor company). In 2017, with Margolin’s permission, [Vikram Oberoi](https://twitter.com/voberoi) scraped the 4,000+ emails and built [atariemailarchive.org](https://atariemailarchive.org/), which groups the messages into [threads](https://atariemailarchive.org/all-threads), [categories](https://atariemailarchive.org/categories), and a [list of favorites](https://atariemailarchive.org/top-threads). The project also includes a [database file](https://github.com/voberoi/atariemailarchive-data) containing each message’s sender, recipients, timestamp, subject, body, and Oberoi’s thread grouping. __Related__: “[How I made atariemailarchive.org](https://vikramoberoi.com/how-i-made-atariemailarchive-org/).”
