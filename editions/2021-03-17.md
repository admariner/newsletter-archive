===================================

*Disasters, nursing-home staffing, Brazil’s vaccination registry, probable news quotations, and British millionaires of the late 1920s.*


__Disasters.__  The [Emergency Events Database](https://www.emdat.be/) (EM-DAT) contains “essential core data on the occurrence and effects of more than 21,000 [natural and technological] disasters in the world, from 1900 to present.” It [focuses on](https://www.emdat.be/explanatory-notes) disasters that have caused 10+ human deaths, affected 100+ people, sparked a state of emergency, and/or prompted a request for international assistance. Where known, the [public dataset](https://public.emdat.be/) (registration required) indicates each disaster’s location, type, start/end dates, and estimated damages; the number of people killed, injured, made homeless, or otherwise affected; and more. __Related__: [The Geocoded Disasters (GDIS) Dataset](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/pend-gdis-1960-2018) (registration required) [provides spatial coordinates](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00846-6) for the natural disasters in EM-DAT from 1960 to 2018.


__Nursing-home staffing.__ The US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires nursing homes to submit [detailed payroll information](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/NursingHomeQualityInits/Staffing-Data-Submission-PBJ), which the agency converts into [public-use files](https://data.cms.gov/browse?q=daily+nurse+staffing) that [summarize](https://data.cms.gov/Special-Programs-Initiatives-Long-Term-Care-Facili/PBJ-Public-Use-Files-Data-Documentation/ygny-gzks) daily staffing levels at each facility. The files count employee and contract hours for dozens of types of staff, ranging from administrators to respiratory therapists. __Related__: “[Maggots, Rape and Yet Five Stars: How U.S. Ratings of Nursing Homes Mislead the Public](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/business/nursing-homes-ratings-medicare-covid.html),” a recent New York Times investigation that uses the data in several ways.


__Brazil’s vaccination registry.__ Brazil’s health ministry is publishing [granular data from its COVID-19 vaccination registry](https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/en/dataset/covid-19-vacinacao), with data on more than 12 million doses administered so far. For each dose, it indicates the patient’s date of birth, sex, race, location, and eligibility group; the vaccine name, manufacturer, and lot; the date and location of vaccination; and more.

__Probable news quotations.__ [Quotebank](https://zenodo.org/record/4277311) is “an open corpus of 178 million quotations attributed to the speakers who uttered them, extracted from 162 million English news articles published between 2008 and 2020.” Its authors [used machine learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437963.3441760) to identify the quotes and speakers, “correctly [attributing] 86.9% of quotations in our experiments.” The five most-quoted people: Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton, and Narendra Modi.

__Early British millionaires.__ Business historian [Peter Scott](https://www.henley.ac.uk/people/professor-peter-scott) has [reconstructed a dataset](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ehr.13025) of Britain’s “[inter-war super-rich](https://ehs.org.uk/britains-inter-war-super-rich-the-1928-9-millionaire-list-2/).” Scott started with an official (but mostly nameless) list of 438 “millionaires” (which tax authorities defined as people with annual incomes above £50,000) from 1928/29, and then cross-referenced the entries with other sources to identify 291 men and 28 women who fit the criteria.
