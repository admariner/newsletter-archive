*Landslides, long-run economic growth, alcohol consumption, art words, and Messi’s moves.*


__Landslides.__ The US Geological Survey has [released](https://www.usgs.gov/tools/us-landslide-inventory-and-susceptibility-map) a [new map of landslide susceptibility](https://usgs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=ae120962f459434b8c904b456c82669d), indicating the specific areas of the country (at 90-meter resolution) that are at greatest risk of slides. The map and county-level metrics are also [available as structured data](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/65ccea5bd34ef4b119cb3bac). To calculate the susceptibilities, [Benjamin B. Mirus et al.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024AV001214) combined data from the agency’s [3D Elevation Program](https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program) and a [national landslide inventory that they updated](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61f326dfd34e622189b93308). The latter provides the location (as a single point or more detailed boundary), timing, number of fatalities, and confidence level for 610,000+ landslides (or evidence of them) in the US since the early 1900s. The researchers also consulted data from state landslide inventories published by [Idaho](https://www.idahogeology.org/product/DD-10), [Maine](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mgs/hazards/landslides/inland/index.shtml), [North Dakota](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndgs/landslides/), and [West](https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2021AM/webprogram/Paper370833.html) [Virginia](https://wvu.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=cb01c47cfa884309b4f38dcd7542f805).


__Long-run economic growth.__ The [Maddison Project Database](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/), [based on](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12618) the work of [Angus Maddison](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/original-maddison) (1926-2010), “provides information on comparative economic growth and income levels over the very long run.” Its [latest release](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2023) includes historical per-capita GDP estimates for 169 countries, in many cases spanning several centuries. In all, the database contains 21,000+ such estimates and another 17,000+ population estimates, drawn from hundreds of sources. __Previously__: The [Penn World Table](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/) ([DIP 2016.08.17](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-08-17-edition/)) — “income, output, input and productivity” estimates now “covering 183 countries between 1950 and 2019” — and the [Long-Term Productivity Database](http://longtermproductivity.com/about.html) ([DIP 2020.04.08](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-04-08-edition/)).


__Alcohol consumption.__ The [National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/)’s [latest consumption surveillance report](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance-reports/surveillance121), published earlier this year, uses sales and shipment data to measure annual alcohol intake by beverage type (beer, wine, spirits) and state. The report and [corresponding data file](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pcyr1970-2022.txt) estimate the likely total and per-capita volumes (of the beverages and of their ethanol content) consumed each year from the 1970s through 2022. __Related__: [Additional surveillance reports](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance-reports) and [the CDC’s list of surveys gathering data on alcohol use](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-data/surveillance-surveys/index.html).

__Art words.__ The [Getty Vocabularies](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/index.html), [published](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/faq.html) by the [Getty Research Institute](https://www.getty.edu/research/), “contain structured terminology for art, architecture, decorative arts, archival materials, visual surrogates, art conservation, and bibliographic materials.” They provide definitions, relationships, translations, and disambiguations for a broad range of terms and entities. Their [Art & Architecture Thesaurus](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/index.html), for example, describes 57,000+ generic concepts (e.g., [lithography](https://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=lithography&logic=AND&note=&english=N&prev_page=1&subjectid=300053271)), while others focus on [artist names](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/index.html), [cultural objects](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/cona/index.html), and [geographies](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/index.html). The records are [available several ways](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/obtain/index.html), including [bulk downloads](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/obtain/download.html).

__Messi’s moves.__ [StatsBomb](https://statsbomb.com/), a soccer/football-data company, publishes a [subset of its detailed, in-play data for free](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data). [Among the offerings](https://statsbomb.com/what-we-do/hub/free-data/): [Every touch, pass, dribble, and shot from Lionel Messi’s 17 seasons playing for Barcelona in La Liga](https://statsbomb.com/news/statsbomb-release-free-messi-data-all-seasons-from-2004-05-2020-21-now-available/). __Related__: [Carlos Menezes](https://www.carlos-menezes.com/)’s [tool for visualizing StatsBomb event data files](https://statsbomb-3d-viz.vercel.app/). __Read more__: [*Net Gains: Inside the Beautiful Game’s Analytics Revolution*](https://www.ryanohanlon.com/net-gains-out-october-18), by [Ryan O’Hanlon](https://www.ryanohanlon.com/bio-contact).
