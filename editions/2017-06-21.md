Data Is Plural — 2017.06.21 edition
===================================

*Traffic stops, famine warnings, open-source projects, electoral manifestoes, and prisoners’ tattoos.*

&nbsp;

**130 million traffic stops.** “Police pull over more than 50,000 drivers on a typical day, more than 20 million motorists every year. Yet the most common police interaction — the traffic stop — has not been tracked, at least not in any systematic way,” according to the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/). To that end, the group has been collecting and standardizing [traffic-stop data from state police agencies](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) across America. Its first data release, published Monday, contains 130 million records from 31 states. The records vary by agency, but the most-complete states include the date, time, location, reason, and outcome of each stop; the driver’s race, gender, and age; whether a search was conducted; and whether the search found contraband. **Related:** [The project’s findings so far](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/findings/). **Previously**: [Raw traffic stop data from a smaller number of states](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2015-10-28-edition) (DIP 2015.10.28).

**Famine warnings.** “Created by USAID in 1985 to help decision-makers plan for humanitarian crises,” the [Famine Early Warning Systems Network](https://www.fews.net/) (FEWS NET) “provides evidence-based analysis on some 34 countries.” As part of its work, FEWS NET [publishes geospatial shapefiles](https://www.fews.net/shapefiles) that score each country’s “most likely food security outcome” on [standardized scale](http://www.fews.net/IPC): Minimal, Stressed, Crisis, Emergency, and Famine. **Previously:** [Global food prices](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-05-17-edition) (DIP 2017.05.17).

**Two million open-source projects, and their dependencies.** [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io) monitors “over 2.4m unique open source projects, 25m repositories and 85m interdependencies between them.” Last week, [the site released](https://medium.com/@BenJam/libraries-io-releases-data-on-over-25m-software-repositories-ab1db665826e) [its first bulk dataset](https://libraries.io/data), which describes each project’s metadata, published versions, and dependencies on other software libraries.

&nbsp;

**Political party manifestoes.** [The Manifesto Project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/) has collected and coded more than 4,000 electoral manifestoes from more than 1,000 political parties in more than 50 countries between 1945 and 2015. For each manifesto, the [project’s dataset](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/datasets) indicates whether the document expresses support for/against dozens of policies and attitudes, including “market regulation,” a “national way of life”, “environmental protection,” and “anti-imperialism.” You can also [browse the manifestoes online](https://visuals.manifesto-project.wzb.eu/mpdb-shiny/cmp_dashboard_corpus/). **Caveat:** The dataset is subject to a [somewhat restrictive usage policy](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/information/terms_of_use).

&nbsp;

**Prisoners’ tattoos.** The Florida Department of Corrections’ [public database](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/obis_request.html) contains a table describing current and released inmates’ tattoos. That data includes each tattoo’s location (e.g., “right arm,” “stomach,” “face”) and description (“cross,” “tribal,” and “skull” being the most common). **Helpful:** [Dan Nguyen’s guide to converting the database into SQLite and CSV files](https://gist.github.com/dannguyen/c6bcc9884c25cf68f3550560ccae5ca8). **Related:** Recent analyses [by The Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21712032-what-can-be-learned-prisoners-tattoos-statistical-analysis-art) and [by The Palm Beach Post](http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/body-art-000-florida-prison-inmates-runs-from-freaky-kinky/HXpaJsmobtJCGPP0vI9WlI/%20).
