*Nursing home inspections, local ideology, COVID-19 in deer, Colombian public-sector algorithms, and forageable fruit.*

*üì¨ Reader [Dea B](https://medium.com/@deabardhoshi) used the [Global Open Data Barometer](https://globaldatabarometer.org/), featured in [DIP 2022.05.18](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-05-18-edition/), to create an [exploratory data story on the state of open data around the world](https://towardsdatascience.com/global-data-barometer-whats-the-current-state-of-open-data-in-the-world-2841e80503c2).

__Nursing home inspections.__ A couple of weeks ago, ProPublica [launched a major update](https://www.propublica.org/article/here-whats-new-in-nursing-home-inspect-database) to its [Nursing Home Inspect](https://projects.propublica.org/nursing-homes/) database, originally published in 2012 (and briefly mentioned in [DIP 2016.07.06](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-07-06-edition/)). The new version ‚Äúincludes more data, new views that summarize problems, and advanced search features.‚Äù As an [accompanying guide](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-use-updated-nursing-home-inspect) explains, the database now ‚Äúcovers nearly 400,000 deficiencies from over 90,000 reports at over 15,000 homes.‚Äù The project links to its source data, including the federal government‚Äôs [list of Medicare-certified nursing homes](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py) and the date, regulation, scope/severity, and narrative text of all deficiencies. __Tip__: [The Seattle Times provides guidance for downloading those deficiency records](https://github.com/seattletimes/nursing_homes_staffing_20200925#deficiency-data). __Later today__: [ProPublica is hosting a webinar about the updated database](https://www.propublica.org/events/how-to-use-propublicas-updated-nursing-home-inspect-database).


__Local ideology.__ ‚ÄúLittle is known about the American public‚Äôs policy preferences at the level of Congressional districts, state legislative districts, and local municipalities,‚Äù [Chris Tausanovitch](https://ctausanovitch.com/) and [Christopher Warshaw](http://www.chriswarshaw.com/) wrote [in the Journal of Politics a decade ago](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s0022381613000042?seq=1). To address the issue, the researchers applied Bayesian statistical methods to large public-opinion surveys to generate numeric ‚Äúideal point‚Äù (left-vs-right) estimates at many geographic levels. Through their [American Ideology Project](https://americanideologyproject.com/), they have since [updated these estimates](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/americanideologyproject), including [most recently with data through 2021](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/BQKU4M). __Previously__: Ideology estimates for [state legislators](https://americanlegislatures.wordpress.com/) ([DIP 2020.01.01](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-01-01-edition/)), [updated in April 2023](https://americanlegislatures.wordpress.com/2023/04/14/april-2023-update-to-shor-mccarty-state-legislatures-data/), and [members of Congress](https://voteview.com/) ([DIP 2023.03.01](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-03-01-edition/)).

__COVID-19 in deer.__ [Aijing Feng et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39782-x) ‚Äúcollected 8,830 respiratory samples from free-ranging white-tailed deer across Washington, D.C. and 26 states in the United States between November 2021 and April 2022.‚Äù The researchers sequenced the COVID-19 genomes from 391 of the samples that tested positive for the virus, finding that the infections ‚Äúoriginated from at least 109 independent spillovers from humans, which resulted in 39 cases of subsequent local deer-to-deer transmission and three cases of potential spillover from white-tailed deer back to humans.‚Äù The [study‚Äôs public spreadsheets](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39782-x#Sec28) include data about each sequenced sample (collection date, state, virus lineage, etc.), each spillover event, and more.

__Colombian public-sector algorithms.__ [Juan David Guti√©rrez et al.](https://juangutierrez.co/2023/06/07/nueva-base-de-datos-caracteriza-113-algoritmos-utilizados-el-sector-publico-colombiano-para-orientar-o-tomar-decisiones/) have compiled a [spreadsheet listing 113 automated decision systems](https://research-data.urosario.edu.co/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34848/YN1CRT) (‚Äúsistemas de decisi√≥n automatizada‚Äù) in the Colombian public sector. Each entry lists the system‚Äôs name, government entity, level of government (national, [department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_Colombia), municipal), sector, description, objectives, data used, various categorizations, and much more. The project also includes a spreadsheet of the 300+ sources used in the compilation.


__Forageable fruit.__ The [Falling Fruit](https://fallingfruit.org/) project ‚Äúis a celebration of the overlooked culinary bounty of our city streets.‚Äù It [provides](https://fallingfruit.org/about) a map ‚Äî ‚Äúnot the first of its kind, but [aspiring] to be the world‚Äôs most comprehensive‚Äù ‚Äî¬†and [downloadable dataset](https://fallingfruit.org/data) of 1.5 million locations of edible plants in public, although not strictly fruit. The entries come from [user contributions](https://fallingfruit.org/changes), as well as [imports of community maps and tree inventories](https://fallingfruit.org/datasets).
