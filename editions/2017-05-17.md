Data Is Plural — 2017.05.17 edition
===================================

*North Korean missile tests, food prices, rising seas, a Chicago PD watchlist, and 112,936 story arcs.*


__North Korean missile tests.__ The [James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies](http://www.nonproliferation.org/) publishes [what it calls](http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/) “the first database to record flight tests of all missiles launched by North Korea capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kilograms a distance of at least 300 kilometers.” The database currently contains 107 missile tests — starting with North Korea’s first, launched in April 1984, to its latest, [launched Sunday morning](https://www.buzzfeed.com/gracewyler/north-korea-reportedly-launches-ballistic-missile). For each test, the data includes the missile’s launch site, highest altitude, distance travelled, landing location, success/failure, and other details.

__Global food prices.__ The UN World Food Programme’s [vulnerability analysis group](http://vam.wfp.org/) collects and publishes [food price data for more than 1,000 towns and cities in more than 70 countries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices). The dataset, which goes back more than a decade, covers basic staples, such as wheat, rice, milk, oil, and more. It’s updated monthly and feeds into (among other things) the UNWFP’s [price-spike indicators](http://foodprices.vam.wfp.org/ALPS-at-a-glance.aspx). __Related:__ [The Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/), which hosts the dataset for the UN. __Also:__ [The Economist’s Big Mac Index](http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index).

__Rising seas.__ How might rising sea levels affect coastal flooding? [A new-ish NOAA Technical Report](http://www.noaa.gov/media-release/new-regional-sea-level-scenarios-help-communities-prepare-for-risks), published in January, combines [historical data on global sea levels](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/understanding-sea-level/key-indicators/global-mean-sea-level) with “regional factors contributing to sea level change for the entire U.S. coastline.” The result: Localized projections under six sea-level rise scenarios, ranging from “low” to “extreme.” You can download the data ([at the bottom of this page](https://scenarios.globalchange.gov/sea-level-rise)) or [explore it on a map](https://coast.noaa.gov/slr/). __Related:__ [Climate Central describes what NOAA’s “extreme” scenario could mean for America](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/extreme-sea-level-rise-stakes-for-america-21387) (including more maps and calculations). __Previously:__ [Tide gauge data](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-03-23-edition) (DIP 2016.03.23) and [sea ice measurements](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-09-14-edition) (DIP 2016.09.14).

__“The watch list Chicago police fought to keep secret.”__ The Chicago Sun-Times [has obtained and published](http://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/what-gets-people-on-watch-list-chicago-police-fought-to-keep-secret-watchdogs/) an August 2016 copy of the Chicago Police Department’s “Strategic Subject List,” a database that scores nearly 400,000 (unnamed) people on a scale from 10 to 500, based on an algorithm that attempts to estimate their risk of being involved in gun violence (either as a shooter or a victim). The database includes demographic, geographic, criminal history, and other information about the people it ranks. “But the database doesn’t indicate — and the police won’t say — how much weight is given to each factor in computing the scores, which are produced using an algorithm developed at the Illinois Institute of Technology,” according to the Sun-Times.


__Story arcs.__ “The WikiPlots corpus is a [collection of 112,936 story plots](https://github.com/markriedl/WikiPlots) extracted from English language Wikipedia.” The plots describe movies, books, plays, TV series, TV episodes, video games, and other stories — essentially, any *thing* that has a Wikipedia article with the word “plot” in one of its subheadings. __Related:__ “[Examining the arc of 100,000 stories: a tidy analysis](http://varianceexplained.org/r/tidytext-plots/)” and “[Gender and verbs across 100,000 stories: a tidy analysis](http://varianceexplained.org/r/tidytext-gender-plots/),” two blog posts by [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/about/) that use the data.
