===================================

*Recessions and expansions, consumer finances, pro-government militias, pollinationships, and atomic gardening.*


__Recessions and expansions.__ The US has no official definition of a recession, but many observers look to the non-governmental [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/about-nber), whose [Business Cycle Dating Committee](https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating) tries to determine “the dates of peaks and troughs that frame economic recessions and expansions.” The committee [publishes a table and data files](https://www.nber.org/research/data/us-business-cycle-expansions-and-contractions) listing those dates for dozens of cycles since the mid-1800s. But [be prepared to wait](https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating/business-cycle-dating-procedure-frequently-asked-questions): “Our determination of the trough date in April 2020 occurred 15 months after that date, in July 2021. Earlier determinations took between 4 and 21 months.” [h/t [USAFacts](https://usafacts.org/articles/what-is-a-recession-what-have-recessions-looked-like-in-the-past/)]


__Consumer finances.__ Every three years since 1983, the US Federal Reserve has conducted its [Survey of Consumer Finances](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/aboutscf.htm), which asks a sample of families detailed questions about their income, savings, assets, pensions, loans, credit lines, demographics, and more. “No other study for the country collects comparable information,” according to the Fed. The [most recent edition](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm) interviewed 5,783 families [between May 2019 and April 2020](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-bulletin-changes-in-us-family-finances-from-2016-to-2019.htm). __Related__: [Moritz Kuhn et al.](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/institute-working-papers/income-and-wealth-inequality-in-america-1949-2016) ([data available here](https://www.moritzschularick.com/academic/datasets-and-codes/)) have merged results from the modern survey with those from an earlier incarnation conducted from 1948 to 1977. __As seen in__: “[Wealth of Two Nations: The U.S. Racial Wealth Gap, 1860-2020](https://economics.princeton.edu/working-papers/wealth-of-two-nations-the-u-s-racial-wealth-gap-1860-2020/)” (Ellora Derenoncourt et al.).

__Pro-government militias.__ [Sabine Carey et al.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20531680211062772)’s [Pro-Government Militias Database](https://www.sabinecarey.com/militias-data) focuses on armed, organized groups that align themselves with a government but are not part of its official security forces. The [latest version](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/YK8L4I), published earlier this year and [browsable online](https://militiasdb.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/militias-public), provides a wide range of structured information about  504 such groups active between 1981 and 2014, including their purpose, membership, targets, government links, material support, and more.


__Pollinationships.__ [Nicholas Balfour et al.](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3801)’s [Database of Pollinator Interactions](https://www.dopi.org.uk/) “documents British pollinator-plant associations,” [bringing together](https://staff.sussex.ac.uk/news/article/58399-new-online-resource-can-help-users-bee-friendly-when-it-comes-to-planting-for-pollinators) records from “disparate publications currently scattered throughout the scientific literature” (and other sources) into a [queryable depository](https://www.dopi.org.uk/search). Its 100,000+ entries document 320,000+ interactions observed between 1,800+ insect species and 1,200+ plant species, some published as early as 1895.

__Atomic gardening.__ The [Mutant Variety Database](https://nucleus.iaea.org/sites/mvd/SitePages/Home.aspx), [jointly maintained](https://www.fao.org/agriculture/fao-iaea-nuclear-techniques/en/) the International Atomic Energy Agency and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, tracks the metaphorical and literal fruits of [atomic gardening](https://www.atomicgardening.com/), a [decades-old practice also known as radiation breeding](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/28/science/28crop.html). The [database’s 3,400+ entries](https://nucleus.iaea.org/sites/mvd/SitePages/Search.aspx) indicate each known variety’s crop type, species, targeted characteristics, mutation development method, country, registration year, and more.
