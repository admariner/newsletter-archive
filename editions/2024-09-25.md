Data Is Plural — 2024.09.25 edition
===================================

*NYC evictions, open-source weather APIs, tree canopies, Canadian mines, and James Beard honorees.*


__NYC evictions.__ New York City’s government publishes a [dataset listing evictions](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4/about_data) “pending, scheduled and executed” since 2017, updated daily. The data are “compiled from the majority of New York City Marshals,” who are [mayor-appointed](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doi/offices/nyc-marshals.page) officers [tasked with enforcing civil court cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Marshal). Each of the 97,000+ rows indicates the eviction court case number, address, property type, eviction type, execution date, and marshal. __Related__: [The city also publishes data on marshals’ annual eviction revenues](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/City-Marshals-Revenue/7ewi-9cdf/about_data). __Also related__: [nycdb](https://github.com/nycdb/nycdb) points to, and helps download, a range of NYC housing–related datasets. __As seen in__: “[Spiking Evictions Renew Calls to Reform NYC Marshals System](https://citylimits.org/2024/08/26/spiking-evictions-renew-calls-to-reform-nyc-marshals-system/),” by [Patrick Spauster](https://patrickspauster.com/) for City Limits.


__Open-source weather APIs.__ [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/), an [open-source](https://github.com/open-meteo/open-meteo) project [built on data from national weather services](https://open-meteo.com/en/about), offers a range of [weather and climate APIs](https://open-meteo.com/en/features#available-apis) that are [free for non-commercial use](https://open-meteo.com/en/pricing). They include [weather forecasts](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/) (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, etc.), [daily historical weather since 1940](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api), [climate change model outputs](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/climate-api), [marine wave forecasts](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/marine-weather-api), [air quality assessments](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/air-quality-api), and more. The project also provides [bulk downloads of the underlying data](https://github.com/open-meteo/open-data) and [self-hosting instructions](https://github.com/open-meteo/open-meteo/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md). __As seen in__: [Jan Kühn](https://yotka.org/)’s [Historical Meteo Graphs](https://yotka.org/meteo-hist).

__Tree canopies.__ The [High Resolution Canopy Height Maps](https://github.com/facebookresearch/HighResCanopyHeight) dataset, [released in April](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/04/22/using-artificial-intelligence-to-map-the-earths-forests/) by Meta and the [World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/about), estimates “tree canopy height at a 1-meter resolution, allowing the detection of single trees at a global scale.” It is available to [explore online](https://meta-forest-monitoring-okw37.projects.earthengine.app/view/canopyheight) and [download](https://registry.opendata.aws/dataforgood-fb-forests/), and was [constructed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442572300439X) by applying machine learning techniques to satellite imagery and [LiDAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) data. The estimates use satellite imagery mostly from 2018–2020, and “when newer imagery is available, the publicly shared model can be used to detect change in canopy heights.” [h/t [Ben Hur Pintor](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benhur07b_bnhr-meta-data-ugcPost-7189501844841291777-7cGt)]


__Canadian mines.__ Economist [Clara Dallaire-Fortier](https://sites.google.com/view/claradallaire-fortier/home) has [compiled](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03116-3) a [dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Principal_Productive_Mines_of_Canada/23740071) of “mine-level estimates for the Canadian mining industry with a persistent annual coverage between 1950 and 2022,” based partly on historical government maps. For each of the 947 mines identified, the dataset indicates its name, location, mining companies, dates open/closed, and commodities produced. __Previously__: [Australian mine production, 1799–2021](https://research-repository.rmit.edu.au/articles/dataset/A_Comprehensive_Dataset_for_Australian_Mine_Production_1799_to_2021/22724081/2) ([DIP 2023.07.12](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-07-12-edition/)). 


__James Beard honorees.__ [Cody Winchester](https://codywinchester.com/) has [constructed a dataset](https://github.com/cjwinchester/james-beard) of [James Beard Foundation Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Beard_Foundation_Award) semifinalists, nominees, and winners since 1991, sourced from the [foundation’s award-search page](https://www.jamesbeard.org/awards/search). For each honoree, the dataset provides their name, year, category, subcategory, and award status, plus additional category-specific variables (such as publisher for the book awards, and location for restaurant and chef awards).
