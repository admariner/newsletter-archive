Data Is Plural — 2017.03.15 edition
===================================

*Visas, sound clips, Freddie Mac home loans, Chicago traffic violations, and constitutional amendments.*


__Who’s visited the U.S. on visas, and how.__ Donald Trump’s new travel ban is scheduled to take effect at 12:01am Eastern tonight. The State Department doesn’t publish realtime visa data, but it does publish historical data, including [the number of non-immigrant visas issued each fiscal year between 1997 and 2016](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/law-and-policy/statistics/non-immigrant-visas.html), by nationality and visa type. (For example, the government issued 226 “fiancé(e)” K-1 visas to Syrian nationals in fiscal year 2016.) The agency also reports how many visas of each type it refused each year, as well as refusal rates by nationality.

__Sounds of YouTube.__ Last week, a research team at Google published [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/), a dataset of “2,084,320 human-labeled 10-second sound clips drawn from YouTube videos.” The clips have been classified into hundreds of categories, including “[plucked string instrument](https://research.google.com/audioset/dataset/plucked_string_instrument.html),” “[computer keyboard](https://research.google.com/audioset/dataset/computer_keyboard.html),” “[chuckle, chortle](https://research.google.com/audioset//dataset/chuckle_chortle.html),” “[snoring](https://research.google.com/audioset/dataset/snoring.html),” and “[fowl](https://research.google.com/audioset/dataset/fowl.html).” [h/t [Suman Deb Roy](https://twitter.com/_RoySD/status/840227343142670336)]


__Many millions of mortgages.__ Freddie Mac — the government-sponsored, publicly traded company also known as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation — publishes [data on 23 million single-family home mortgages](http://www.freddiemac.com/news/finance/sf_loanlevel_dataset.html) it has originated or guaranteed since 1999. The dataset includes the loan amount and interest rate, the borrower’s credit score, the property type (e.g., condo, co-op, manufactured housing), metro area, first payment month, whether the borrower is a first-time homebuyer, and lots more. Freddie Mac requests that you register before downloading the data, but [you can also access the files directly](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/5x0tws/freddie_mac_fixedrate_mortgage_dataset_from/). Don’t miss the [terms and conditions](https://freddiemac.embs.com/FLoan/HistoricalDataTerms.html), which prohibit republishing the files. __Previously:__ [Data on millions more loans from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2015-12-30-edition) (Dec. 30, 2015).


__Chicago traffic camera violations.__ The Windy City publishes two datasets on traffic violations. One tallies the daily number of [speeding violations in each Children’s Safety Zone](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4/); the other, [red-light violations at each camera-surveilled intersection](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Red-Light-Camera-Violations/spqx-js37). Both go back to July 2014. The city also publishes a [spreadsheet of city-towed vehicles](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Towed-Vehicles/ygr5-vcbg). __Related:__ [The Chicago Tribune’s long-running investigation into the city’s traffic camera troubles](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/redlight/).

__Nearly every proposed amendment to the Constitution.__ To prepare for an exhibition last year, the National Archives and Records Administration created a dataset of more than [11,000 constitutional amendment proposals](https://www.archives.gov/open/dataset-amendments.html) introduced in Congress between 1787 and 2014.
