Data Is Plural — 2019.01.30 edition
===================================

*Fatal and non-fatal gun crime, hourly rainfall, ethnonationalism, uncertain spellings, and Twin City radio spins.*


__Fatal and non-fatal gun crime.__ On Thursday, Sarah Ryley, Sean Campbell, and I published [a deeply-reported investigation into U.S. cities’ failure to solve shootings](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahryley/police-unsolved-shootings) — a year-long collaboration between [The Trace](https://www.thetrace.org/) and [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/). To reach [our quantitative findings](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahryley/5-things-to-know-about-cities-failure-to-arrest-shooters), we analyzed (and standardized) [three major FBI datasets](https://github.com/the-trace-and-buzzfeed-news/federal-crime-data-analysis), [internal data from 22 police departments](https://github.com/the-trace-and-buzzfeed-news/local-police-data-analysis), and [a database of Baltimore victims and suspects](https://github.com/the-trace-and-buzzfeed-news/baltimore-shootings-analysis). Data, code, and methodologies for the analyses are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/the-trace-and-buzzfeed-news/introduction). __Related:__ Last year, The Washington Post published [Murder with Impunity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/where-murders-go-unsolved/?utm_term=.a53db2e96521), a series examining unsolved homicides; their data, on 52,000+ homicides in 50 cities, is also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides).


__Hourly rainfall.__ Since 1997, the [Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018296?WT.ec_id=SDATA-201901) (PERSIANN) algorithm has [used satellite imagery](http://chrs.web.uci.edu/SP_activities00.php) to estimate rainfall rates around the world. The system’s hourly, daily, monthly, and annual estimates can now be [explored online and downloaded](https://chrsdata.eng.uci.edu/).


__Ethnonationalism.__ Christina Isabel Zuber and Edina Szöcsik’s [Ethnonationalism in Party Competition dataset](http://christinazuber.com/data/) compiles ratings for more than 200 political parties in 22 European countries. Experts rated the parties twice — first in 2011, and then again in 2017 — on a range of factors, such as the centrality of ethnonationalism to the parties’ platforms, and their positions on territorial autonomy for minorities. (Dataset access requires providing a name and email address.) [h/t [Erik Gahner](https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData)]


__Uncertain spellings__. “Funemployed programmer” [Colin Morris](http://colinmorris.github.io/about/) looked for all the times where commenters on Reddit added “(sp?)”, or a related annotation, to their remarks. E.g., “[SF is putting on quite a show, especially Kapernick (sp?).](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/16h0ih/our_most_comments_in_a_game_thread_record_didnt/c7vyofl/)” Morris then compiled a [dataset of the words that preceded those annotations](https://github.com/colinmorris/reddit-dubious-spelling), accompanied by examples of their usage.

__Twin City radio spins.__ “[Shane Nackerud needed to know](http://www.citypages.com/music/what-songs-artists-has-the-current-played-most-since-2009-this-u-of-m-librarian-crunched-the-numbers/504392941): Does 89.3 the Current play the Replacements every day?” To figure it out, the University of Minnesota librarian extracted track listings from 1.1 million [@currentplaylist](https://twitter.com/currentplaylist) tweets from 2009 through 2018. He’s also published the [total play counts by artist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ByxdKfjDQ7RtSvLRaufHPa7hYSLXfzUO9QaFgVf_fJc/edit#gid=1779654962) and [the raw data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XuWC9oTuQkwYlP6R6ljsOIpvMWfC-meZ/view). [h/t [Kent Gerber](https://twitter.com/ktkgerber/status/1085944034240225281) + [Amy Riegelman](https://twitter.com/amylibrarian/status/1085668015008608256)]
