*üì¨ Reader¬†[Erin Wilson](https://erinmichelle.squarespace.com/) has built a [range of visualizations and analyses](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/erin.wilson4049/viz/WhatarewewatchingonNetflix/NetflixDashboard) based on the [Netflix viewership data](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-a-netflix-engagement-report) featured in [DIP 2023.12.20](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-12-20-edition/) ‚Ä¶ [and a video walking you through it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuTrvsWaAUk).

__Institutional investments.__ If you‚Äôre an institutional investor with US operations and managing at least $100 million in publicly traded securities, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires you to file [Form 13F](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/form-13f-reports-filed-institutional-investment) each quarter. (The biggest filers ‚Äî such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street ‚Äî have trillions of dollars invested.) These filings, [available to download going back to mid-2013](https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/form-13f), detail each investor‚Äôs long positions for each security: their number of shares, market value, security type, issuer name, [CUSIP code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUSIP), and more. __As seen in__: Michigan teenager [Anonyo Noor](https://github.com/leftmove)‚Äôs [wallstreetlocal.com](https://www.wallstreetlocal.com/), which [aggregates the data](https://github.com/leftmove/wallstreetlocal), matches it to additional information, and provides a search interface.


__Human development, indexed.__ Perhaps the best-known metric of its kind, the United Nations‚Äô [Human Development Index](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index) combines statistics on life expectancy, income per capita, and years of schooling into a single number for each country-year. The UN provides [downloads](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/documentation-and-downloads) and an [API](https://api.hdrdata.org/swagger/index.html) for all annual HDI ratings and sub-components for 1990 to 2022. Those resources also feature data from related indices, such as the [Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index](https://hdr.undp.org/inequality-adjusted-human-development-index#/indicies/IHDI), [Gender Development Index](https://hdr.undp.org/gender-development-index#/indicies/GDI), and [Gender Inequality Index](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/thematic-composite-indices/gender-inequality-index#/indicies/GII).

__Extrajudicial killings in Bangladesh.__ Between 2009 and 2022, ‚ÄúBangladesh‚Äôs security forces killed at least 2,597 people in apparent extrajudicial executions, custodial torture, and by firing bullets at protesters,‚Äù according to [Nazmul Ahasan](https://nazmulahasan.com/)‚Äôs [analysis for Netra News](https://interactive.netra.news/extrajudicial-killings-bangladesh/), building on data ‚Äúcompiled by Bangladeshi human rights defenders and collated by the Australia-based [Capital Punishment Justice Project](https://www.cpjp.org.au/resources/bangladesh).‚Äù Ahasan and colleagues ‚Äúindependently verified more than 98% of the cases in the dataset using press reports and subsequently updated any incomplete data.‚Äù The records are available as a table in the article and [as a JSON file](https://interactive.netra.news/extrajudicial-killings-bangladesh/data.json). Each entry includes the victim‚Äôs name (if known), incident date, description, location, agencies involved, purported justification, and news source. __As seen in__: [The 2024 Sigma Awards](https://www.sigmaawards.org/meet-the-winners-of-the-sigmas-2024-for-data-journalism/).


__Agri-environmental policies.__ [David Wuepper et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-024-00945-8) have constructed a [dataset of 6,000+ policies](https://zenodo.org/records/10842614) between 1960 and 2022 ‚Äúat the intersection of agriculture and the environment, implemented not only by national entities but also by subnational and supranational entities, covering different instruments (for example, regulations, frameworks, payment programmes) and topics,‚Äù such as the [US Safe Drinking Water Act](https://www.epa.gov/sdwa), the [Bavarian Forestry Law](https://www.fao.org/faolex/results/details/en/c/LEX-FAOC072608/), and [Tanzania‚Äôs 2009 Wildlife Conservation Act](https://www.fao.org/faolex/results/details/en/c/LEX-FAOC097858/). Each entry lists the policy‚Äôs country, title, type, keywords, year implemented, description, and other details.


__Rolling Stone‚Äôs album rankings.__ A [new visual essay from The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/2024/03/greatest-music/) compares *Rolling Stone*‚Äôs ‚Äú500 Greatest Albums of All Time‚Äù lists from 2003, 2012, and 2020. A methodology note says the project began with a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QguM-JM3LAJuZlnmY8aN0MutBJrZAzDs3aWZWTtF1WU/edit#gid=0) by [Chris Eckert](https://twitter.com/kennybloggins/status/1308568487888064518) and eventually led the authors to develop a [dataset of their own](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c_Tdnm7S1oo8R9UNtdCVIY7bYASmf_cvMynOJTpKuHA/edit). Theirs lists every album in the rankings ‚Äî its name, genre, release year, 2003/2012/2020 rank, the artist‚Äôs name, birth year, gender, and more ‚Äî plus each year‚Äôs voters.
