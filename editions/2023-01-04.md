Data Is Plural — 2023.01.04 edition
===================================

*Prison-banned books, severe weather warnings, congregations and adherents, UAE art establishments, and one billionaire’s donations.*


__Prison-banned books.__ The Marshall Project is building a [database of books banned from state prisons](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/21/prison-banned-books-list-find-your-state), based on official lists that reporters requested from each state’s correctional agency. The browsable and [downloadable](https://observablehq.com/@themarshallproject/prison-banned-books) database includes roughly 50,000 entries from 18 states so far, with plans for expansion. The fields include the book’s title, author, date banned, and reason for banning, although availability varies by state. (Disclosure: I did some [contract work](https://www.jsvine.com/consulting/pdf-data-extraction/) for this project, extracting data from PDFs.) __Read more__: “[Why Would Prisons Ban My Book? Absurdities Rule the System](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/21/prison-banned-books-new-york-florida-censorship),” by Marshall Project reporter Keri Blakinger. __Previously__: [School-banned books](https://pen.org/banned-in-the-usa/) ([DIP 2022.07.06](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-07-06-edition/)).


__Severe weather warnings.__ Among its many services, the [Iowa Environmental Mesonet](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/) provides a range of [National Weather Service data interfaces and downloads](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/nws/), including current and historical [severe weather warnings, watches, and advisories](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/gis/watchwarn.phtml). Coverage for tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, and marine warnings goes back to 1986; in more recent decades, the data include [dozens of additional phenomena](https://github.com/akrherz/pyIEM/blob/d7afb8de354775e922cb8ce3d8f865871e78f179/src/pyiem/nws/vtec.py#L43), such as *freezing fog*, *high surf*, *dense smoke*, and *excessive heat*. The records [indicate](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/info/datasets/vtec.html) each alert’s geospatial boundaries, time of issuance and expiration, forecast office, status, and more.


__Congregations and adherents.__ A [successor](https://www.usreligioncensus.org/index.php/about-census) to the federal government’s [Census of Religious Bodies](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2010/01/26/a-brief-history-of-religion-and-the-u-s-census/) (1890–1936), the [US Religion Census](https://www.usreligioncensus.org/) is now conducted every 10 years by the [Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies](http://www.asarb.org/). The researchers [approach](https://www.usreligioncensus.org/index.php/methods) “formal denominations and religious groups,” from which they [collect](https://www.usreligioncensus.org/index.php/data_collected) “data on the number of congregations, members, adherents, and attendees” at a county level. Results for the 2021 study, [available as spreadsheets and maps](https://www.usreligioncensus.org/node/1639), include responses from 370+ faith groups. __Previously__: [The National Congregations Study](https://sites.duke.edu/ncsweb/) ([DIP 2021.12.29](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-12-29-edition/)).

__UAE art establishments.__ As part of her doctoral research into the role of women in the United Arab Emirates’ art scene, [Eve Grinstead](https://ihmc.ens.psl.eu/-GRINSTEAD-Eve-.html?lang=en) has compiled [three tables of relevant data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/SWDKKK), listing 99 galleries, nine fairs, and eight auction houses in the country. Each row includes the establishment’s name, date founded, specialty, owners/founders, city (or Dubai neighborhood), and Grinstead’s notes.


__One billionaire’s donations.__ Last month, billionaire [MacKenzie Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacKenzie_Scott) unveiled a [website for her philanthropic efforts](https://yieldgiving.com/). It features a [downloadable table](https://yieldgiving.com/gifts/) that lists 1,600+ donations doled out since 2019, with each gift’s year, amount (replaced with “disclosure delayed for benefit of recipient” for 28% of entries), and recipient organization. __Read more__: “[MacKenzie Scott reveals details of her $14bn in donations to 1,600 non-profits](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/15/mackenzie-scott-billionaire-donations-non-profits)” (The Guardian).
