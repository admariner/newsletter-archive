Data Is Plural — 2019.12.04 edition
===================================

*Income inequality, ambassadorial qualifications, Samoa’s measles outbreak, science PhD candidates, and the Database of British and Irish Hills.*


__Income inequality around the world, over time.__ Political scientist [Frederick Solt](https://fsolt.org/)’s [Standardized World Income Inequality Database](https://fsolt.org/swiid/) provides annual [Gini coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) for 196 countries and territories. For many, the calculations go back to the 1960s. The database draws on [hundreds of sources](https://fsolt.org/swiid/swiid_source/), including international organizations, national statistical offices, and academic studies. In an [accompanying paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mwnje/), Solt argues that the SWIID represents an improvement over other similar efforts, such as the United Nations University’s [World Income Inequality Database](https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/wiid-world-income-inequality-database) ([DIP 2016.06.01](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-06-01-edition)).

__Ambassadorial qualifications.__ The Foreign Service Act of 1980 requires US presidents to provide Congress a “report on the demonstrated competence” for each ambassadorial nominee. In 2014, the government began [disclosing these records](https://www.state.gov/resources-bureau-of-human-resources/), which had long been held secret. But the government’s policy applied only to new nominees. Law professor [Ryan Scoville](https://ryanscoville.com/about/), however, used the Freedom of Information Act to pry loose the rest — more than three decades of concise biographies — and, earlier this year, [put them online](https://ryanscoville.com/2019/02/13/certificates-of-competency-for-nominees-to-be-chiefs-of-mission-1980-2014/), accompanied by a dataset that describes the nominees’ qualifications and political contributions. __Related__: “[Unqualified Ambassadors](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3333988),” Scoville’s *Duke Law Journal* article on the topic, and [his summary in *Lawfare*](https://www.lawfareblog.com/troubling-trends-ambassadorial-appointments-1980-present).

__Samoa’s measles outbreak.__ The Samoan government has been [tweeting updates](https://twitter.com/samoagovt/status/1201637336515112960) regarding [the country’s measles crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Samoa_measles_outbreak). Epidemiologist [Chris von Csefalvay](https://bitsandbugs.io/chris-von-csefalvay/) has been [converting those tweets into a simple dataset](https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/samoa-measles-2019) that counts the number of cases and deaths (by age group) at the time of each tweet.


__Science PhD candidates.__ Last month, *Nature* released [findings](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7) and [response data](https://figshare.com/s/74a5ea79d76ad66a8af8) from its fifth survey of science graduate students. The questionnaire covered demographics, motivations, ambitions, satisfaction, mental health, and other topics. More than 6,000 students participated, including 1,000+ each living in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. __Related__: [*Nature*’s editorial board calls for “urgent attention” to students’ mental health](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03489-1).

__British Isle bumps.__ [The Database of British and Irish Hills](http://www.hills-database.co.uk/index.html) began 20 years ago and now catalogs more than 20,000 bits of bumpy terrain. The [data files](http://www.hills-database.co.uk/downloads.html) include detailed coordinates, map references, and descriptive characteristics.
