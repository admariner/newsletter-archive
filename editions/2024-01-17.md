*RSV, subnational economic output, environmental treaties, Chicago‚Äôs ‚Äúmenu money,‚Äù and Star Trek chairs.*


*üì¨ Reader [Andy Pickering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andypicke/) recently [analyzed and visualized](https://andypicke.quarto.pub/portfolio/posts/USPVDB/USPVDB_Analysis.html) the [US Large-Scale Solar Photovoltaic Database](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uspvdb/) featured in [DIP 2023.12.13](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-12-13-edition/).

__RSV.__ The US CDC‚Äôs [Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net/index.html) collects data on hospital admissions due to lab-confirmed [RSV](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html) at acute-care facilities in 58 counties, across 12 states. The CDC uses the data to estimate weekly hospitalization rates ‚Äî overall as well as by age group, race/ethnicity, and sex. Those rates, which go back to 2016‚Äì17 for adults and 2018‚Äì19 for minors, are available via an [interactive dashboard](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net/dashboard.html) and [downloadable dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-Rates-of-Laboratory-Confirmed-RSV-Hospitali/29hc-w46k/about_data). __Related__: The network is part of a [broader system](https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/resp-net/dashboard.html) that also monitors [influenza](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/influenza-hospitalization-surveillance.htm) and [COVID-19 hospitalizations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covid-net/purpose-methods.html). __Also__: The [European Respiratory Virus Surveillance Summary](https://erviss.org/), [launched in October](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-and-who-launch-new-surveillance-tool-respiratory-viruses-improve-early-detection) by the European CDC and World Health Organization, features weekly data tables and epidemiological summaries.


__Subnational economic output.__ [Leonie Wenz et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02323-8)‚Äôs [Database of Sub-national Economic Output](https://zenodo.org/records/7573249) (DOSE) provides ‚Äúharmonised data on reported economic output from 1,661 sub-national regions across 83 countries from 1960 to 2020.‚Äù  Those regions include, for instance, Turkey‚Äôs 81 provinces, Japan‚Äôs 47 prefectures, and Kenya‚Äôs 47 counties. For each year, the dataset indicates the monetary value of the region‚Äôs total economic output, and often also subtotals for the agricultural, manufacturing, and services sectors. While previous projects have used interpolation to estimate similar figures, DOSE avoids that approach, instead [assembling its data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02323-8/tables/1) only from ‚Äústatistical agencies, yearbooks and academic literature.‚Äù


__Environmental treaties.__ [Ronald B. Mitchell](https://rmitchel.uoregon.edu/)‚Äôs [International Environmental Agreements Database Project](https://iea.uoregon.edu/) tracks [4,000+ such arrangements](https://iea.uoregon.edu/iea-project-contents), [defined](https://iea.uoregon.edu/international-environmental-agreements-ieas-defined) as ‚Äúan intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources.‚Äù Examples include the [Indus Water Treaty](https://iea.uoregon.edu/treaty/198) (1960) and [Convention on Nuclear Safety](https://iea.uoregon.edu/treaty/3197) (1994). The project‚Äôs [datasets](https://iea.uoregon.edu/ieadb-and-related-datasets) characterize each agreement (e.g., its name, signature date, type, subject) and 100,000+ ‚Äúmembership actions‚Äù by participating countries. The project also tracks various ‚Äúnon-agreements,‚Äù such as memoranda of understanding. [h/t [Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Morin et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-023-09495-3)]


__Chicago‚Äôs ‚Äúmenu money.‚Äù__ Chicago‚Äôs 50 wards can each receive up to $1.5 million annually to spend on infrastructure projects such as street lighting, sidewalk repair, art murals, and park improvements. Each ward‚Äôs city council representative typically decides how to spend this so-called ‚Äúmenu money,‚Äù although [some let residents allocate a portion](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/8/3/23819111/chicago-vote-tax-money-spent-wards-participatory-budgeting-democracy-solutions-project). The city [publishes](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/obm/provdrs/cap_improve/svcs/aldermanic-menu-program.html) menu money spending reports, but [only as PDFs](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/obm/provdrs/cap_improve/svcs/cip-archive.html). So data researcher [Jake J. Smith](https://jakejeromesmith.wordpress.com/) has [programmatically converted](https://github.com/jakejsmith/ChicagoMenuMoney) twelve years of those PDFs (2012‚Äì2023) into a [spreadsheet containing 28,000 line items](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MZpUnD8bXceRw-P3fiTZtH7KtSunNaEYa-xpapWw1Ho/edit). Each entry [indicates](https://github.com/jakejsmith/ChicagoMenuMoney/blob/main/data-dictionary.md) the year, ward, line item‚Äôs cost, category, program, and description (often the location of the project).


__Star Trek chairs.__ [Ex Astris Scientia](https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/), [run by Bernd Schneider since 1998](https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/misc/introduction.htm), contains much of what you might expect from a *Star Trek* fan site, such as [episode summaries](https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/index-episodes.htm), [starship catalogs](https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/index-starships.htm), and an [extensive encyclopedia](https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/treknology.htm). But it also publishes some more esoteric inventories, such as HTML tables of [commercially available chairs](https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/database/chairs-trek.htm) and [lamps](https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/database/lighting-trek.htm) that have appeared on screen.
