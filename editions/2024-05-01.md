*üì¨ Reader¬†[Jeremy Ney](https://twitter.com/jeremybney) has just published [an edition of his American Inequality newsletter](https://americaninequality.substack.com/p/wiretaps-and-inequality) that analyzes [the wiretap data](https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/analysis-reports/wiretap-reports) featured in [DIP 2019.07.03](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-07-03-edition/).

__Prison commissary prices.__ Through a series of public records requests, reporters at [The Appeal](https://theappeal.org/) have [constructed](https://theappeal.org/locked-in-priced-out-commissary-database-methodology/) the ‚Äú[first national database of prison commissary lists](https://theappeal.org/commissary-database/),‚Äù based on documents provided by 46 states. The database contains [three tables](https://github.com/the-appeal/commissary-data/). The [first](https://github.com/the-appeal/commissary-data/blob/main/data/commissary-lists-20240417.csv) links to, and provides metadata about, each list. The [second](https://github.com/the-appeal/commissary-data/blob/main/data/commissary-summaries-20240417.csv) summarizes each state‚Äôs prices for two dozen types of products ‚Äî such as ramen, toothpaste, and rosary beads ‚Äî across three categories: food, personal care/hygiene, and religious items. The [third table](https://github.com/the-appeal/commissary-data/blob/main/data/commissary-prices-20240417.csv) provides 2,200+ commissary-specific prices for those products. __Read more__: ‚Äú[Locked In, Priced Out: How Prison Commissary Price-Gouging Preys on the Incarcerated](https://theappeal.org/locked-in-priced-out-how-much-prison-commissary-prices/),‚Äù by reporters [Elizabeth Weill-Greenberg](https://theappeal.org/authors/elizabeth-weill-greenberg/) and [Ethan Corey](https://theappeal.org/authors/ethan-corey/).

__Historical markers.__ [Launched in 2006](https://www.hmdb.org/about.asp), the [Historical Marker Database](https://www.hmdb.org/) ‚Äúis an illustrated searchable online catalog of historical information viewed through the filter of [‚Ä¶] permanent outdoor markers, monuments, and plaques.‚Äù The [crowdsourced](https://www.hmdb.org/faq.asp) project has documented 195,000+ markers in the US, plus thousands more in Canada, Mexico, the UK, and elsewhere. You can browse them [by location](https://www.hmdb.org/geolists.asp) and [by topic](https://www.hmdb.org/categories.asp), and download data corresponding to each collection. You can also [search](https://www.hmdb.org/search.asp) by person, keyword, historical date, and other attributes. __As seen in__: ‚Äú[Historical markers are everywhere in America. Some get history wrong](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/21/1244899635/civil-war-confederate-statue-markers-sign-history),‚Äù by NPR‚Äôs [Laura Sullivan](https://www.npr.org/people/4624985/laura-sullivan) and [Nick McMillan](https://www.npr.org/people/1083208720/nick-mcmillan), with [associated data analysis](https://github.com/NPR-investigations/off-the-mark).

__Biological numbers.__ [BioNumbers](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/search.aspx) wants ‚Äúyou to find in one minute any useful molecular biology number that can be important for your research.‚Äù As its creators [Ron Milo et al. described in 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2808940/), those numbers ‚Äúrange from cell sizes to metabolite concentrations, from reaction rates to generation times, from genome sizes to the number of mitochondria in a cell.‚Äù You can search, [browse](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/browse.aspx), and [download](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/resources.aspx) more than 14,000 entries. Each includes a number and/or range, units and method of measurement, relevant organism, and source. For instance: [The diameter of an *e. coli* cell is 1-1.1 micrometers](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?id=100002&ver=12&trm=100002&org=), the [lifespan of a human red blood cell is 70-140 days](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?id=112478&ver=0&trm=red+blood+cell&org=a), and a [chicken‚Äôs genome has 1.05 billion base pairs](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?id=100282&ver=6&trm=genome&org=).


__Openly-licensed video transcripts.__ The [YouTube-Commons](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PleIAs/YouTube-Commons) dataset, built by a French startup, contains 15 million original and auto-translated audio transcripts from 2 million [Creative Commons‚Äìlicensed](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) YouTube videos, sourced from 400,000+ channels. The dataset indicates each video‚Äôs YouTube ID, title, channel, and date, as well as each transcript‚Äôs original language, translated language, word count, and character count. Translations are available primarily in Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish. [h/t [Data Machina](https://datamachina.substack.com/p/data-machina-250)]


__Agatha Christie‚Äôs bibliography.__ [Nicole Mark](https://www.nicoledesignsdata.net/) has compiled a [dataset of Agatha Christie‚Äôs published stories](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A8ZRe5KLLAllhT31pCzke4j5qAPqeMKf0jYgyJXcoPs/edit#gid=0), covering 75 novels, 154 short stories, and 22 short story collections. The spreadsheets provide each work‚Äôs title and the character-based series to which it belongs (e.g., Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, etc.). The novel and collection entries also indicate their year of initial publication, while the short-story entries list the collections that included them.
