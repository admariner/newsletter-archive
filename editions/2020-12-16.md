Data Is Plural — 2020.12.16 edition
===================================

*Enslaved.org, more PPP details, more on travel/immigration bans, Third-Republic France, and cyber wargames.*


__People of slavery.__ [Recently launched](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/sweeping-new-digital-database-emphasizes-enslaved-peoples-individuality-180976513/), [Enslaved.org](https://enslaved.org/) allows the public to “explore or reconstruct the lives of individuals who were enslaved, owned slaves, or participated in the historical trade.” Its interactive database contains 600,000+ records, with plans to expand. The [collaborative, schlolar-led project](https://enslaved.org/about) also includes [The Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation](https://jsdp.enslaved.org/), which “publishes original, peer-reviewed datasets about the lives of enslaved Africans and their descendants.” The [first issue](https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullIssue/volume1-issue1) features three datasets [originally published](http://slavebiographies.org/databases.php) through a [precursor](https://enslaved.org/projectHistory) to Enslaved.org — [Slave Biographies: The Atlantic Database Network](http://slavebiographies.org/about.php). Those [datasets](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/jsdp) focus on [Louisiana slaves](https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue1-louisiana-slave-database) (1719–1820), [New Orleans “Free Blacks”](https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue1-free-blacks-database) (1840–1860), and [enslaved Africans in Maranhão, Brazil](https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue1-maranhao-inventories-slave-database) (1767–1831).


__More PPP details.__ Thanks to a FOIA lawsuit by a group of news organizations, the US Small Business Administration has [released additional data](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sba-releases-detailed-information-on-more-small-business-borrowers-under-ppp-pandemic-relief-effort-11606874820) about the financial assistance distributed through its Paycheck Protection Program. Previously ([DIP 2020.07.08](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-07-08-edition)), the SBA’s public data withheld the specific amounts for all loans (instead listing only a broad range), as well as names and addresses for loans below $150,000. [The new datasets](https://sba.app.box.com/s/5myd1nxutoq8wxecx2562baruz774si6) include those amounts, names, and addresses for all loans.


__More on travel/immigration bans.__ The [COVID Border Accountability Project](https://covidborderaccountability.org) is tracking countries’ pandemic-related travel and immigration restrictions, on a weekly basis. The [project’s team](https://covidborderaccountability.org/about.html) categorizes various aspects of the restrictions — whether they hinge on citizenship, halt new visa applications, et cetera — and turns them into [a longitudinal dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/U6DJAC). __Previously__: [The UN World Food Program’s travel-restrictions dataset](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/covid-19-global-travel-restrictions-and-airline-information) ([DIP 2020.12.09](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-12-09-edition)).


__Third-Republic France.__ Economist [Victor Gay](https://sites.google.com/site/victorgayeco/) has built [a geographic dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/TRF-GIS) that traces, year by year, the administrative boundaries of [France’s Third Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic), which governed from 1870 to 1940, when the Vichy Regime took power. The dataset [provides](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02951461) annual shapefiles delineating the country’s départements, arrondissements, and cantons; as well as for its “most significant special administrative constituencies: military, judicial and penitentiary, electoral, academic, labor inspection, and ecclesiastical.”


__Cyber wargames.__ [This](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920306788) is, “to the best of our knowledge, [...] the first dataset providing network traffic traces and corresponding event logs from a complex cyber defense exercise” — a two-day [Cyber Czech](https://csirt.muni.cz/projects/cyber-czech) event in March 2019.
