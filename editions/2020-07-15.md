Data Is Plural — 2020.07.15 edition
===================================

*1.75 million US COVID patients, more goverment responses to the coronavirus, COVID cases in migrant worker dorms, 43 million court case citations, and old British lighthouses.*


__1.75 million US COVID patients.__ The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published a [dataset containing demographic and medical information on 1.75 million deidentified COVID-19 patients](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). For each confirmed or probable case, the dataset report reports the patient’s age group and race/ethnicity, the date of their initial symptoms, whether they were hospitalized, whether they had an “underlying morbidity or disease,” and more — although several of the fields contain high percentages of “unknown” values. The dataset is similar to the one The New York Times got from the CDC [through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-data-united-states.html) (see: “[The Fullest Look Yet at the Racial Inequity of Coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html)”), but it does not specify the patient’s county.

__More government responses to the coronavirus.__ The [CoronaNet Research Project](https://www.coronanet-project.org/) aims “to collect as much information as we can about the various fine-grained actions governments are taking to defeat the coronavirus.” The project, which has drawn contributions from more than 400 researchers around the world, published its [initial release](https://www.coronanet-project.org/download.html) a few weeks ago, and now details nearly 16,000 policy events in nearly 200 countries. __Related__: The nonprofit [Hikma Health](https://www.hikmahealth.org/) says [it has compiled](https://www.hikmahealth.org/map) “the largest county-level COVID-19 policy dataset in the nation,” covering 1,200 US counties and more than 120 Native American communities. [The dataset](https://github.com/hikmahealth/covid19countymap/tree/gh-pages) indicates the dates on which each jurisdiction undertook various responses, such as closing schools and restricting large gatherings.

__COVID cases in migrant worker dorms.__ The anonymous author of [Squirrelling Data](https://squirrellingdata.wixsite.com/home/) has been [collating information](https://squirrellingdata.wixsite.com/home/post/singapore-covid-19-data) from the Singapore Ministry of Health’s [coronavirus press releases](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/). Among the datasets: [daily case counts in dozens of migrant worker dormitories](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NcoRQkvlPTiXh1_CWtjQFyyGXNTY5enbRPNLf4cHuhc/edit#gid=0), which [have been hit hard](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/singapore-million-migrant-workers-suffer-as-covid-19-surges-back).

__Case citations.__ The [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/about/) ([DIP 2018.11.07](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-11-07-edition)) has begun publishing a [citation graph](https://case.law/download/citation_graph/), a dataset listing the previous cases that each court decision cites. The [latest release](https://case.law/download/citation_graph/2020-05-08/) covers 43 million citations. The project also provides aggregated versions of the data, plus [interactive graphics](https://case.law/exhibits/cite-grid) showing the frequency of citations to and from courts in each state.


__Old British lighthouses.__ The [Historical Light Aids to Navigation](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/854172/) dataset “shows the development of historical lighthouses, lightships, harbour lights and beacons in England and Wales for several benchmark years between 1514-1911,” [drawn from](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920308854) navigational charts, government publications, and other sources. For each of the 600+ entries, the dataset provides the light aid’s name, geocoordinates, and (when available) its visibility range, height, and number of lights.
