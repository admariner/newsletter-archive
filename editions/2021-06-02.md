*Lynching victims, gun-dealer violations, more police misconduct complaints, UK lobbying, and fermentative microbes.*


__Lynching victims.__ In the 1880s–1910s, the Chicago Tribune, Tuskegee University, and the NAACP each began collecting data on lynchings in the US. In the 1990s, sociologists [Stewart Tolnay](https://soc.washington.edu/people/stewart-tolnay) and [E.M. Beck](https://sociology.uga.edu/directory/people/e-m-beck) reverified, standardized, and extended those three collections, compiling a now-seminal dataset that described 2,800+ victims of these mob-led extrajudicial killings — the majority of whom were Black — in 10 Southern states from 1882–1930. The researchers shared a copy of that data with [Project HAL](http://people.uncw.edu/hinese/HAL/HAL%20Web%20Page.htm), where you can download it. Meanwhile, they and collaborators have continued [updating and expanding the research](http://lynching.csde.washington.edu/#/about); you can [request access to their latest datasets](http://lynching.csde.washington.edu/#/contact). In 2019, sociologists [Charles Seguin](http://www.charlieseguin.com/) and [David Rigby](https://rigby.netlify.app/) published [a dataset](https://osf.io/kr8yc/) that [aims to complement Tolnay and Beck’s](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023119841780) by presenting information ([and an interactive map](http://davidrigbysociology.com/lynching_dot_map)) on 1,328 lynching victims in 38 additional states from 1883–1941.

__Gun-dealer violations.__ “The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives inspects thousands of licensed gun dealers and manufacturers each year, but what happens in those investigations is rarely revealed to the public.” So reporters at The Trace and USA Today [compiled](https://projects.thetrace.org/inspections/methodology/) a [database](https://projects.thetrace.org/inspections/) of nearly 2,000 ATF inspections between July 2015 and June 2017 with violations, based on PDFs obtained [through a FOIA lawsuit](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6170066/brady-center-to-prevent-gun-violence-v-us-department-of-justice/) by the [Brady gun control group](https://www.bradyunited.org/). It [includes](https://www.thetrace.org/2021/05/atf-inspection-records-gun-stores-guide/) dealer information, lists of violations, final dispositions, and more. __Read more__: “[The ATF Catches Thousands of Lawbreaking Gun Dealers Every Year. It Shuts Down Very Few.](https://www.thetrace.org/2021/05/atf-inspection-report-gun-store-ffl-violation/)” __Previously__: [The ATF’s licensing database](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2015-11-04-edition/) ([DIP 2015.11.04](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2015-11-04-edition/)).


__More police misconduct complaints.__ The [New York Civil Liberties Union](https://www.nyclu.org/) has updated its [NYPD misconduct complaint database](https://github.com/new-york-civil-liberties-union/NYPD-Misconduct-Complaint-Database-Updated) to include “the race or ethnicity of the impacted person and officer, incident location, current employment status of the officer, and other data,” and to remove duplicates in the original records obtained from the city. __Also__: Philadelphia publishes [monthly-updated data](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/police-complaints) on police complaints from the past five years. __Previously__: [ProPublica’s subset of the NYPD data](https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-ccrb/) ([DIP 2020.07.29](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-07-29-edition/)); and [CPDP’s database of complaints against Chicago officers](https://cpdp.co/) ([DIP 2015.11.25](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2015-11-25-edition/)). __Read more__: The Financial Times has [compared and analyzed](https://github.com/Financial-Times/police-misconduct-complaints-analysis) these cities’ datasets, [finding](https://www.ft.com/content/141182fc-7727-4af8-a555-5418fa46d09e) that the 10% most-cited officers account for roughly a third of all complaints.

__Lobbying in Britain.__ [Open Access UK](https://openaccess.transparency.org.uk/) is a database of 70,000+ meetings between lobbyists and government ministers going back to 2012. The records have been [compiled by Transparency International UK](https://openaccess.transparency.org.uk/about.php) from scattered official publications; they list the date of the meeting, the lobbying organization, the minister lobbied, and a brief description of the meeting’s purpose.

__Fermentative microbes.__ The [World Institute of Kimchi](https://www.wikim.re.kr/index.es?sid=a2)’s [Omics Database of Fermentative Microbes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00895-x) provides “genome, metagenome, metataxonome, and (meta)transcriptome sequences” of bacteria and other microorganisms associated with a variety of fermented foods. You can [search the sequenced microbes](https://odfm.wikim.re.kr/) by taxonomy, research study, and food sampled.
