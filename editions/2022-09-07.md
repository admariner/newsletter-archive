*LGBTQ+ rights, the General Social Survey, most buildings in Spain, battles and sieges, and even more street trees.*


__LGBTQ+ rights.__ [Equaldex](https://www.equaldex.com/) tracks LGBTQ+ rights around the world, categorizing the liberties and restrictions that relate to more than a dozen issues, such as same-sex marriage, blood donation, military service, employment discrimination, and the right to change one’s legal gender. The [collaboratively-edited](https://www.equaldex.com/help) database [provides an API](https://equaldex.stoplight.io/docs/equaldex/YXBpOjE1NjI0OTIw-equaldex-json-api) to [retrieve those categorizations and contextual notes](https://equaldex.stoplight.io/docs/equaldex/b3A6MTU2MjQ5MjE-get-lgtbq-rights-by-region-id) by country and/or US state. The project also keeps tabs on [developments that alter those rights](https://www.equaldex.com/timeline) and [public opinion polling](https://www.equaldex.com/surveys).

__Five decades of US public opinion.__ This year marks the [50th anniversary](https://gss.norc.org/pages/GSS50.aspx) of the [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/), which [calls itself](https://gss.norc.org/About-The-GSS) “the only full-probability, personal-interview survey designed to monitor changes in both social characteristics and attitudes currently being conducted in the United States.” It combines a “standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions” with shorter-lived modules on topics such as religion, gun control, and mental health. You can [explore the results online](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/) and also [download](https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data) the [thoroughly documented](https://gss.norc.org/Get-Documentation), anonymized microdata. __Related__: [The International Social Survey Program](https://issp.org/), co-founded by the GSS team.


__Most buildings in Spain.__ The Spanish government’s [cadastral service](https://www.sedecatastro.gob.es/) provides [geospatial data on every parcel, address, and building](https://www.sedecatastro.gob.es/Accesos/SECAccDescargaDatos.aspx) for “the entire territory under its jurisdiction (the entire national territory except the Basque Country and Navarre).” The records, [available to download programmatically](https://www.catastro.minhap.es/webinspire/index_eng.html), include each building’s year of construction, total floor area, number of dwellings, and more. __As seen in__: “[Spain lives in flats: why we have built our cities vertically](https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/)” (El Diario, [original in Spanish](https://especiales.eldiario.es/espana-vive-en-pisos/)), and [associated Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/raulsanchezglez/status/1443469518307799044).

__Battles and sieges.__ [Charles Miller and K. Shuvo Bakar](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00220027221119085)’s [Historical Conflict Event Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6ZFC0V) covers 8,800+ military clashes spanning thousands of years, from [Egypt’s capture of Megiddo c. 1468 BC](https://www.britannica.com/place/Megiddo) to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The authors draw primarily from [Tony Jaques](https://www.issueoutcomes.com.au/about.html)’s [Dictionary of Battles and Sieges](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL9393993W/Dictionary_of_Battles_and_Sieges), which they augment with additional research and sources. The [resulting spreadsheet](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=6434093&version=1.0) provides each event’s name, year, relevant war, narrative, participant list, location, and more.

__Even more street trees.__ [Dakota E. McCoy et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.18.484862v1.full) have built a [dataset of 5,000,000+ urban trees](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.2jm63xsrf), [gathered and harmonized](https://github.com/ReallyMcCoy/CityTreesProject) from 63 US cities’ inventories. The level of detail differs by city, but can include the tree’s species, date planted, location, height, trunk diameter, condition, and more. The authors also provide [range of summary statistics for each city](https://github.com/ReallyMcCoy/CityTreesProject/blob/main/DataS2_Tree_Data_Summary_By_City_REV1.csv) __Previously__: Street trees in [DIP 2020.11.18](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-11-18-edition/), [DIP 2018.08.08](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-08-08-edition/), and [DIP 2016.11.16](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-11-16-edition/).
