*üîÑ The [Marine Regions](https://www.marineregions.org/) project, featured in [DIP 2021.09.29](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-09-29-edition/), has [released version 12](https://www.marineregions.org/files/newsletter_v12.htm) of its [maritime boundaries dataset](https://www.marineregions.org/downloads.php#marbound), adding ‚Äúnew and more detailed line types‚Äù and ‚Äúupdated with newly established baselines, treaties, and court rulings.‚Äù*

 
__Opioid settlements.__ [OpioidSettlementTracker.com](https://www.opioidsettlementtracker.com/), [run by lawyer Christine Minhee](https://www.opioidsettlementtracker.com/about), asks: ‚ÄúWill opioid settlements be spent in ways that bolster the public health response to drug use?‚Äù Minhee has compiled a series of spreadsheets to help answer that question. They track the [status and reported values of settlements](https://www.opioidsettlementtracker.com/globalsettlementtracker/#statuses) between 14 companies (opioid manufacturers, distributors, and others) and US states (plus DC and Puerto Rico), [states‚Äô plans for spending those settlements](https://www.opioidsettlementtracker.com/settlementspending#plans), and [their promises to publicly report such spending](https://www.opioidsettlementtracker.com/publicreporting/#promises). __Read more__: ‚Äú[$50 Billion in Opioid Settlement Cash Is on the Way. We‚Äôre Tracking How It‚Äôs Spent](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/opioid-drugmakers-settlement-funds-50-billion-dollars-khn-investigation-payback/),‚Äù a KFF Health News article using Minhee‚Äôs data, part of a [broader project on the topic](https://kffhealthnews.org/opioid-settlements/). 


__Financial offshoring.__ The [Atlas of the Offshore World](https://atlas-offshore.world/) ‚Äî ‚Äúa new effort by the [EU Tax Observatory](https://www.taxobservatory.eu/),‚Äù a research group based at the Paris School of Economics ‚Äî aims ‚Äúto inform the global debate around international tax evasion and avoidance.‚Äù Its [four main datasets](https://atlas-offshore.world/download-data/) provide country-level estimates of [international profit shifting](https://atlas-offshore.world/dataset/global-profit), [offshore financial wealth](https://atlas-offshore.world/dataset/offshore-financial), [offshore real estate ownership](https://atlas-offshore.world/dataset/offshore-real-estate), and [50+ years of effective tax rates](https://atlas-offshore.world/dataset/effective-tax). __Read more__: The team‚Äôs ‚Äú[Global Tax Evasion Report 2024](https://www.taxobservatory.eu/publication/global-tax-evasion-report-2024/)‚Äù and ‚Äú[The History Behind the Atlas of the Offshore World](https://www.taxobservatory.eu/the-history-behind-the-atlas-of-the-offshore-world/).‚Äù [h/t [Matt Collin](https://sites.google.com/view/mattcollin/home)]


__Minority-serving colleges.__ The [MSI Data Project](https://www.msidata.org/) provides a [dashboard](https://www.msidata.org/data) and [dataset](https://www.msidata.org/publications) focused on colleges and universities that qualify federally as [minority-serving institutions](https://www.msidata.org/msis) either through their mission (e.g., [HBCUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities)) or through enrollment. The project examines institutions‚Äô funding status, location, student body, and degree granting for 2017‚Äì2021. It draws on records from the Department of Education‚Äôs ‚Äú[eligibility matrices](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/idues/eligibility.html)‚Äù for each MSI designation and the agency‚Äôs [Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) (IPEDS). __As seen in__: ‚Äú[Beyond the Rankings: The College Welcome Guide](https://hechingerreport.org/beyond-the-rankings-the-college-welcome-guide/),‚Äù by The Hechinger Report‚Äôs [Fazil Khan](https://hechingerreport.org/author/fazil-khan/), incorporating data from both IPEDS and the MSI Data Project.

__Childcare inspections.__ ‚ÄúAcross 41 states, one in ten licensed daycare facilities is overdue for an inspection,‚Äù according to an [analysis by USAFacts](https://usafacts.org/data-projects/childcare-inspections), which gathered inspection-timing data for 148,000 facilities. The analysis‚Äôs downloadable datasets indicate the number of facilities overdue (versus on-time or unknown) in each state and county, as well as the distribution of days-since-last-inspection in each state. Most of the inspection data had to be programmatically collected from state portals, [according to Amber Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amberrthomas_are-states-meeting-their-childcare-inspection-activity-7120861735833518080-V-6s/), except for California, which [publishes bulk data](https://www.ccld.dss.ca.gov/carefacilitysearch/DownloadData) (including inspection dates) about all childcare facilities.


__Two Zurich buses.__ [Fabio Widmer et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02600-6)‚Äôs [ZTBus dataset](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/626723) provides detailed data from 1,409 ‚Äúdriving missions‚Äù of two electric public transit buses in Zurich, Switzerland. Each mission typically represents a full day‚Äôs operation. The records, which span early 2019 to late 2022, include ‚Äútime series that represent the power demand, propulsion system, odometry, global position, ambient temperature, door openings, number of passengers, and the dispatch patterns within the public transportation network of the two vehicles.‚Äù
