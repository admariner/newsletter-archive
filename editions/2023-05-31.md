Data Is Plural ‚Äî 2023.05.31 edition
===================================

*Correctional control, local business, crowd accidents, Antarctic geology, and NYC sidewalk scaffolding.*


*üëã Based on reader feedback, I'm exploring the idea of writing one or more in-depth guides to specific datasets.  I'd be grateful if you filled out [this short survey on the topic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHY_AmJIYoLBwvwaskiyNiPuOIh1rHQC0xmvnJm4Vw5OVsfQ/viewform). Thanks!*


__Correctional control.__ The [Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/)‚Äôs [Punishment Beyond Prisons report](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/correctionalcontrol2023.html) cross-references data from the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://bjs.ojp.gov/) and several other sources to [count or estimate](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/correctionalcontrol2023.html#methodology) the [number of people under eight forms of ‚Äúcorrectional control‚Äù in each state and DC](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/correctionalcontrol2023_data_appendix.html): federal prisons, state prisons, local jails, Indian Country jails, youth confinement, involuntary commitment, parole, and probation ‚Äî approximately 5.5 million people in total. __Related__: The [Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement](https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/research-and-statistics/research-projects/Census-of-Juveniles-in-Residential-Placement/overview), one of the report‚Äôs sources, provides a [tool to tabulate youth confinement counts](https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezacjrp/) by sex, age, race, status, offense, and facility characteristics.

__Local business.__ Despite the name, the Census Bureau‚Äôs [County Business Patterns](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp.html) datasets [cover a range of geographic units](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/data/datasets.html), including states, congressional districts, metro areas, counties, and ZIP codes. Generated from the Bureau‚Äôs confidential [Business Register](https://www.census.gov/econ/overview/mu0600.html), they provide the number of establishments and ([noise-infused](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/technical-documentation/methodology.html#par_textimage_245304869)) employee counts and payroll figures, disaggregated by [industry code](https://www.census.gov/naics/). Last month, the Bureau [released](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/2021-county-business-patterns.html) the [data for 2021](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2021/econ/cbp/2021-cbp.html). Historical availability varies; the Bureau directly provides data for counties back to 1986, and for ZIP codes back to 1994, for example. [Fabian Eckert](https://www.fpeckert.me/) and colleagues, meanwhile, have converted two older archives of the records into comparable data, spanning [1946 to 1974](https://www.fpeckert.me/elmmss/) and [1975 onward](https://www.fpeckert.me/cbp/).


__Crowd accidents.__ [Claudio Feliciani et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753523001169) have compiled a [dataset of 281 crowd accidents](https://zenodo.org/record/7523480) from 1900 to 2019, based on ‚Äúa comprehensive investigation of the press and media reports.‚Äù The researchers focus on accidents with at least one fatality or ten injuries ‚Äúcaused by a collective crowd motion which could have been potentially prevented by employing a different design or through a proper crowd management.‚Äù The dataset lists each accident‚Äôs date, country, coordinates, gathering type (sport, religious, political, etc.), fatality and injury counts, crowd size, and sources. The deadliest accident included, by far, is the [2015 Mina stampede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Mina_stampede).

__Antarctic geology.__ Antarctica‚Äôs surface is mostly ice, but there‚Äôs also lots of rock. In a [recent paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02152-9), the [Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research](https://www.scar.org/)‚Äôs [GeoMAP team](https://www.scar.org/science/former-groups/geomap/) describes building the ‚Äúfirst detailed geological map dataset covering all of Antarctica,‚Äù assembled and refined from 589 sources. The [dataset](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.951482), which you can [download](https://data.gns.cri.nz/ata_geomap/index.html?content=/mapservice/Content/antarctica/Download.html) or [explore as an interactive map](https://data.gns.cri.nz/ata_geomap/index.html?map=Antarctic_v2022), uses 99,000+ polygons to describe the rock-scape, associating each unit with a name (or group name), rock type, [lithology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithology), geologic period, [and more](https://geomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


__NYC sidewalk scaffolding.__ New York City‚Äôs Department of Buildings publishes a [map and dataset](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/html/sidewalk-shed-map.html) of active permits for ‚Äú[sidewalk sheds](https://www.nyc.gov/site/buildings/safety/sidewalk-sheds.page),‚Äù the ubiquitous, temporary structures (often colloquially called scaffolding) meant to shield pedestrians from falling debris. Each of the ~9,000 entries indicates the permit address, date issued, material, linear feet, age, and more. The oldest shed has had a permit for more than 17 years. __Read more__: [An introduction to the sheds and several visualizations of the data](https://observablehq.com/@betanyc/what-are-sidewalk-sheds), by BetaNYC‚Äôs [Zhi Keng He](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhi-keng-he-870072156).
