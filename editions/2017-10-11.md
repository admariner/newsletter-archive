Data Is Plural — 2017.10.11 edition
===================================

*Wildfires, political crowds, truck and bus safety, bay water, and chicken-dancing.*


__Wildfires.__ “[Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity](https://www.mtbs.gov/project-overview) (MTBS) is an interagency program whose goal is to consistently map the burn severity and extent of large fires across all lands of the United States”; the [most recent release](https://www.mtbs.gov/articles/announcement/data-release-may-1-2017) contains more than 20,000 fires from 1984 to 2015. You can [explore the data online](https://www.mtbs.gov/viewer/index.html), or [download it in bulk](https://www.mtbs.gov/direct-download). For more recent data, see [GeoMAC](https://www.geomac.gov/), which aims to map all current wildfires; [NOAA’s Hazard Mapping System](http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/hms.html), which uses satellites to detect fire locations and smoke plumes; and [NASA’s MODIS and VIIRS datasets](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data), which provide satellite-based detections for the entire globe. __Previously:__ [National Fire Incident Reporting System](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-07-20-edition), which also includes structure fires and vehicle fires (DIP 2016.07.20).

__Political crowd estimates.__ The [Crowd Counting Consortium](https://sites.google.com/view/crowdcountingconsortium/about), launched earlier this year, is a volunteer effort to “[collect] publicly available data on political crowds reported in the United States, including marches, protests, strikes, demonstrations, riots, and other actions.” The team publishes [monthly spreadsheets](https://sites.google.com/view/crowdcountingconsortium/view-download-the-data?authuser=0) that list each crowd’s date, location, type, and cause (e.g., “Oppose removal of confederate statue”); high and low size estimates; the number of reported arrests and injuries; links to sources; and additional details. __Related:__ The project’s main coordinators have been [summarizing their findings on the Washington Post’s Monkey Cage blog](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/09/25/charlottesville-and-its-aftermath-brought-out-many-protesters-in-august-but-still-more-were-against-trump-and-his-policies/).

__Commercial vehicle safety.__ The [Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/) helps to regulate the United States’ large trucks and passenger buses. The [datasets available through its Safety Measurement System](https://ai.fmcsa.dot.gov/SMS/Tools/Downloads.aspx) include a census of all regulated carriers, the results of safety inspections, and reported crashes. The crash files list the number of injuries and fatalities; the weather, light, and road conditions; the involved vehicle’s VIN and license plate number; and more.

__San Francisco Bay water.__ The U.S. Geological Survey has been measuring water quality in the San Francisco Bay for nearly 50 years. The agency recently published [210,826 of these measurements](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5841f97ee4b04fc80e518d9f), collected from dozens of monitoring stations between April 1969 and December 2015. (It’s “one of the longest records of water-quality measurements in a North American estuary,” according to [a recent academic article describing the data](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201798).) Each row specifies the measurement’s date, station, depth, temperature, and salinity; many rows include levels of chlorophyll, oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, and other matter.


__Humans in motion.__ Carnegie Mellon’s [Motion Capture Database](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/) provides data files and videos representing humans performing various activities: shaking hands, drinking soda, exchanging “angry hand gestures,” doing cartwheels, mopping floors, laughing, chicken-dancing, and oh-so-much more.
