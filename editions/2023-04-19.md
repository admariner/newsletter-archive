*Municipal zoning rules, AI incidents, state bill trajectories, rare-earth mining projects, and ‚Äúpirate radio‚Äù enforcement.*


*üì¨ Reader [Idil](https://moneyzine.com/author/idil-woodall/) used the [FDIC‚Äôs list of failed banks](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/) ([DIP 2023.03.15](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-03-15-edition/)) to [analyze and visualize trends in those failures by year and state](https://moneyzine.com/news/2023/04/12/georgia-is-home-to-16percent-of-americas-failed-banks-since-the-2000s/), for Moneyzine.

__Municipal zoning rules.__ [Matt Mleczko](https://mattmleczko.scholar.princeton.edu/) and [Matthew Desmond](https://matthewdesmond.scholar.princeton.edu/), of Princeton‚Äôs [Eviction Lab](https://evictionlab.org/) ([DIP 2018.04.18](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-04-18-edition/)), have [developed a method](https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/2YGAQ9JE5S6PYXHVTBZG/full) for extracting structured information from the text of local zoning regulations. Their [National Zoning and Land Use Database](https://github.com/mtmleczko/nzlud) covers 2,600+ cities, towns, and other municipalities ‚Äî a sample drawn from the [Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index](https://real-faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/gyourko/land-use-survey/)‚Äôs prior, survey-based research. The database includes dozens of indicators, such as whether the rules specify annual limits on several types of permits, allow any [accessory dwelling units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_suite), require various review-board approvals, impose parking space minimums, and more. These factors then feed into the authors‚Äô [Zoning Restrictiveness Index](https://evictionlab.org/zoning-restrictiveness-index/), which they calculate at a municipal and metro-area level.


__AI incidents.__ The [AI Incident Database](https://incidentdatabase.ai/) ‚Äúis dedicated to indexing the collective history of harms or near harms realized in the real world by the deployment of artificial intelligence systems.‚Äù The [open-source](https://github.com/responsible-ai-collaborative/aiid) project is ‚Äú[managed in a participatory manner](https://incidentdatabase.ai/about/),‚Äù with a board of directors, submissions from the public, and a team of reviewers guided by a [set of definitions and decision criteria](https://incidentdatabase.ai/editors-guide/). So far, it has cataloged 500+ incidents and 2,500+ reports, which you can [search and filter](https://incidentdatabase.ai/apps/discover/) by [entity](https://incidentdatabase.ai/entities/), [category](https://incidentdatabase.ai/taxonomies/), date, and other facets. You can also [download full snapshots of the database](https://incidentdatabase.ai/research/snapshots/).  [h/t [Sasha Anderson](https://twitter.com/sashananderson)]


__State bill trajectories.__ Political scientist [Alex Garlick](https://www.alexgarlick.com/) has published a [dataset categorizing bills‚Äô trajectories in state legislatures](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/8PTHXT). It follows each proposed law‚Äôs journey along 23 possible steps, which range from ‚ÄúFirst Reading (first chamber)‚Äù to ‚ÄúBill enacted.‚Äù The dataset spans more than 1 million bills tracked by [OpenStates](https://openstates.org/) ([DIP 2020.09.30](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-09-30-edition/)), with full coverage for all 50 states for 2011‚Äì18 and partial coverage for some earlier and later years. __Read more__: ‚Äú[Bicameralism Hinges on Legislative Professionalism](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/lsq.12422),‚Äù Garlick and [Adam R. Brown](https://adambrown.info/)‚Äôs recent paper (and [preprint](https://adambrown.info/docs/research/brown-garlick-2023-bicameralism.pdf)) using this data.


__Rare-earth mining.__ [Shuang-Liang Liu et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136823001439) have compiled a [dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136823001439#s0060) of 146 mining projects targeting [rare-earth elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_element), which serve as ‚Äúcritical raw materials in many low-carbon technologies.‚Äù The dataset lists each project‚Äôs name, company, location, status, deposit type, estimated tonnage of deposits, element composition, and other details sourced from ‚Äúcompany annual reports and public presentations, government reports, and papers in various scientific journals.‚Äù 

__‚ÄúPirate radio‚Äù enforcement.__ The Federal Communications Commission [publishes](https://www.fcc.gov/pirate-database) a [dashboard](https://opendata.fcc.gov/stories/s/wgq8-eb5c) and [dataset](https://opendata.fcc.gov/Pirate-Radio-Enforcement/Pirate-Radio-Broadcasting-Database/xqgr-24et) of its ‚Äúpirate radio‚Äù enforcement actions, part of the agency‚Äôs [crackdown against](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-first-pirate-act-fines-totaling-more-2-million) the ‚Äúunauthorized transmission of radio frequency signals on the frequencies in or adjacent to the FM and AM radio bands.‚Äù The 38 entries list the entity targeted, state/territory, radio frequency, enforcement type, date issued, and penalty amount. They go back to early 2020, when Congress passed the [PIRATE Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/583). __Related__: [Congressional acronym abuse, 1973-2013](https://noahveltman.com/acronyms/).
