Data Is Plural — 2020.12.02 edition
===================================

*Student loans, rural facilities in India, more coups, Jefferson’s weather, and integer sequences.*


__Student loans.__ The US Department of Education publishes a range of [aggregate datasets on federal student loans](https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student), including the [amounts outstanding](https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/portfolio) ($1.5+ trillion overall, from 43 million students), volumes of financial aid [requested](https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/application-volume) and [awarded](https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/title-iv) (by student demographic and by school), [default rates](https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/default), and [forgiveness](https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/loan-forgiveness).


__Rural facilities in India.__ As part of its [Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana](http://omms.nic.in/) [road-development program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pradhan_Mantri_Gram_Sadak_Yojana), India’s Ministry of Rural Development has gathered data on 700,000+ rural facilities, which data-science engineer [Pratap Vardhan](https://pratapvardhan.com) has [organized into state-level CSV files](https://github.com/pratapvardhan/rural-facilities-pmgsy). The information includes each facility’s name, category (e.g., education, medical, etc.), subcategory, state, district, block, address, and geocoordinates. __Related__: [An exploratory Twitter thread by Vardhan](https://twitter.com/PratapVardhan/status/1332174593877020673), who says, “This is probably the largest open indian geo-tagged dataset I’ve seen!? It’s mostly great!?”


__More coups.__ Last month, the University of Illinois’ [Cline Center for Advanced Social Research](https://clinecenter.illinois.edu) published version 2.0 of its [Coup D’état Project](https://clinecenter.illinois.edu/project/research-themes/democracy-and-development/coup-detat-project-cdp), a [dataset](https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-9651987) detailing more than 900 coups, attempted coups, and coup conspiracies from 1945 to 2019. Each entry indicates the country and date, plus the “type of actor who initiated the coup (i.e. military, palace, rebel, etc.) as well as the fate of the deposed executive (killed, injured, exiled, etc.).” __Previously__: [Powell and Thyne’s coup dataset](https://www.jonathanmpowell.com/coup-detat-dataset.html) ([DIP 2016.07.20](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-07-20-edition)).


__Jefferson’s weather.__ From July 1776 to June 1826, Thomas Jefferson [recorded](https://jefferson-weather-records.org/node/40574) thousands of nearly-daily weather observations — temperatures, precipitations, humidities, wind speeds — at Monticello, Paris, Milan, and scores of other locations. Now [a UVA/Princeton collaboration](https://jefferson-weather-records.org/node/41011) has [turned those handwritten records](https://jefferson-weather-records.org/node/40566) into an [explorable](https://jefferson-weather-records.org/node/40568) and [downloadable](https://jefferson-weather-records.org/node/41009) database.

__Integer sequences.__ The [decades-old](https://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome#OEIS:_Brief_History), frequently-updated, and [downloadable](https://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome#Compressed_Versions) [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org/) contains more than 338,000 lists of [those things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_sequence). Each has some particular significance, ranging from the famous ([the Fibonacci numbers](https://oeis.org/A000045)) to the intriguing ([“days required to spread gossip to n people”](https://oeis.org/A007456)) to the obscure ([“numbers n such that 2^n + 35 is prime”](https://oeis.org/A056561)) to the super-obscure. __Related__: [This xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/2016/) and [its impact](https://oeis.org/A316600).
