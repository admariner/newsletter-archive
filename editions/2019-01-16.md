*Journalists killed, congressional district demographics, political parties, shipping logs, and dairy.*


__Journalists killed, imprisoned, and missing.__ The Committee to Protect Journalists maintains a [database of journalists who‚Äôve been killed](https://cpj.org/data/killed) for [reasons related to their work](https://cpj.org/data/methodology). The database goes back to 1992 and contains more than 1,300 entries, with details about the journalists, the circumstances of their deaths, and whether perpetrators have been convicted. More recently, the organization has also begun publishing data on journalists who‚Äôve been [imprisoned](https://cpj.org/data/imprisoned) or [gone missing](https://cpj.org/data/missing).

__Congressional district demographics.__ The Census Bureau‚Äôs [My Congressional District tool](https://www.census.gov/mycd/) lets you browse (and download) demographic, socioeconomic, and business data corresponding to each of the country‚Äôs 435 congressional districts. Political scientist Ella Foster-Molina has compiled a [historical dataset containing similar information for 1972 to 2014](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CI2EPI); it also contains details about each district‚Äôs representatives ‚Äî such as their personal characteristics, the committees they served on, and the number of bills they sponsored.

__Political party data, linked.__ [Party Facts](https://partyfacts.herokuapp.com/) is a ‚Äúcollaborative data collection‚Äù that links various political-party datasets together. The project has [two main tables](https://partyfacts.herokuapp.com/download/). One contains basic information about 4,100+ political parties in more than 200 countries, including each party‚Äôs mother-tongue name and English translation, year founded, and Wikipedia page. The second table cross-references each party with its unique identifier in [26 external datasets](https://partyfacts.herokuapp.com/data/), such as [ParlGov](http://www.parlgov.org/) ([DIP 2018.09.19](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-09-19-edition)), [The Manifesto Project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/) ([DIP 2017.06.21](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-06-21-edition)), and the [Constituency-Level Elections Archive](http://www.electiondataarchive.org/) ([DIP 2016.09.28](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-09-28-edition)).

__Old shipping logs.__ In previous centuries, maritime officers kept ‚Äú[detailed log books of the ships‚Äô activities and management](https://webs.ucm.es/info/cliwoc/object.htm),‚Äù including observations of the wind and weather. The [Climatological Database for the World's Oceans 1750-1850](https://webs.ucm.es/info/cliwoc/) has digitized a quarter-million entries from such logbooks, originally written in Dutch, English, French, and Spanish, and [published them as detailed, structured data](http://projects.knmi.nl/cliwoc/). __Helpful:__ Steven Ottens has [converted the project‚Äôs fixed-width files into tab-delimited data](https://stvno.github.io/page/cliwoc/).

__Moooooooooo.__ The U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äôs [Dairy Data Set](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/dairy-data/) contains annual tabulations of production, sales, imports, exports, consumption, and other economic aspects of ‚Äúthe U.S. dairy situation.‚Äù __As seen in:__ ‚Äú[Nobody Is Moving Our Cheese: American Surplus Reaches Record High](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683339929/nobody-is-moving-our-cheese-american-surplus-reaches-record-high)‚Äù (NPR).
