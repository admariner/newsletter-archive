Data Is Plural — 2016.03.09 edition
===================================

*Billionaires, legislative linguistics, historical mortgages, crossword plagiarism, and baseball.*


__Two thousand billionaires.__ Researchers have compiled a [multi-decade database of the super-rich](http://www.iie.com/publications/interstitial.cfm?ResearchID=2917). Building off the [*Forbes* World’s Billionaires](http://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/) lists from 1996–2014, scholars at Peterson Institute for International Economics have added a couple dozen more variables about each billionaire — including whether they were self-made or inherited their wealth. (Roughly half of European billionaires and one-third of U.S. billionaires got a significant financial boost from family, the authors estimate.)


__Legislative linguistics.__ The Sunlight Foundation’s [Capitol Words project](http://capitolwords.org/) lets you explore the frequency of words and phrases in the Congressional Record since 1996. For example: ["weapons of mass destruction"](http://capitolwords.org/term/weapons_of_mass_destruction/), [“war” vs. “peace”](http://capitolwords.org/?terma=war&termb=peace), or [“Obamacare”](http://capitolwords.org/term/Obamacare/). The underlying [data is available via an API](http://capitolwords.org/api/1/).


__Historical mortgages.__ With the help of volunteers, the New York Public Library is transcribing [6,000+ mortgage and bond ledgers](http://emigrantcity.nypl.org/#/intro) from Emigrant Savings Bank, founded in 1850 and the oldest such bank in the city. You can [search the transcribed records](http://emigrantcity.nypl.org/#/data/browse), or [download the (very) raw data](http://emigrantcity.nypl.org/#/data/download).


__Overlapping crosswords.__ The cruciverb industry is facing its first [major plagiarism scandal](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-plagiarism-scandal-is-unfolding-in-the-crossword-world/), unearthed thanks to a newly-published [database of crosswords that are at least 25% similar to previous-published puzzles](http://xd.saul.pw/xdiffs/).


__Baseball, baseball, baseball.__ If you’re looking for historical data on baseball teams, players, salaries, or managers, [Sean Lahman’s Baseball Archive](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) likely has it. The archive was updated with data from the 2015 season last week. __Related:__ [Retrosheet’s game logs — a record of every major league game since 1871](http://www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/index.html).
