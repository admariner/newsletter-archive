__HealthCare.gov plans.__ A [series of datasets](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data-Resources/marketplace-puf) from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services describes all the plans available through the government’s health insurance marketplace. The information resembles that available through [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/), but is provided as structured, downloadable files. The datasets describe the costs, benefits, networks, service areas, and other aspects of 27,000+ plans offered by hundreds insurers in 2022, plus similar data for each year since 2014.

__Political apologies.__ The [Political Apologies Database](https://www.politicalapologies.com/?page_id=74), part of a [broader research project on the theme](https://www.politicalapologies.com/),  is “an inventory of political apologies offered by states or state representatives to a collective for human rights violations that happened in the recent or distant past.” The current version describes 300+ apologies offered between 1947 and 2021, indicating the countries and officials who offered them, the countries and groups that received them, classifications of the apologized-for violations, and other context. __Read more__: “[Examining the ‘age of apology,’](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00223433211024696)” a study summarizing [the researchers](https://www.politicalapologies.com/?page_id=234)’ findings.

__Border changes.__ The [CShapes 2.0](https://icr.ethz.ch/data/cshapes/) dataset “maps the borders and capitals of independent states and dependent territories from 1886 to 2019,” and includes the specific dates of each change. It’s available in a range of formats and [as an interactive graphic](https://cshapes.ethz.ch/). __Read more__: [Guy Schvitz et al.](https://icr.ethz.ch/publications/cshapes-2/) describe the dataset’s creation and how it compares to others. __Related__: [Steven V. Miller](http://svmiller.com/)’s [Territorial Change](https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/territorial-change) dataset, which “records all peaceful and violent changes of territory from 1816-2018.” [h/t [Mojmír Polák](https://twitter.com/Pmojmir/status/1481577831582736384) + [Scott F.

__PISA results and responses.__ Through tests and questionnaires, the OECD’s [Programme for International Student Assessment](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/) examines the math, science, and reading proficiency, learning environments, and attitudes of hundreds of thousands 15-year-olds in [dozens of countries around the world](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/pisa-participants.htm). Its [public datasets](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/) include students’ results and responses from seven assessment waves, dating from 2000 to 2018. __As seen in__: “[Sex differences in adolescents’ occupational aspirations: Variations across time and place](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0261438),” a study using 2018 PISA data.

__Born-digital artworks.__ In 1999, the new-media-art nonprofit [Rhizome](https://rhizome.org/) launched [ArtBase](https://artbase.rhizome.org/), “an archive of born-digital artworks.” Last year, it [relaunched the project](https://rhizome.org/editorial/2021/apr/26/the-artbase-relaunches-welcome-to-linked-open-data/) as a [linked data](https://artbase.rhizome.org/wiki/About#Linked_Open_Data) resource, allowing you [run complex and detailed queries](https://artbase.rhizome.org/wiki/Query) across the collection’s 2,200+ entries.
