Data Is Plural — 2015.10.21 edition
===================================

*Your weekly glimpse into the information-structuring habits of the human species.*

**Every place name in the United States.** Sometimes, bureaucracy creates poetry. Since 1890, the [U.S. Board on Geographic Names](http://geonames.usgs.gov/index.html) has been cataloguing, standardizing, and promulgating official names for the places we hike, swim, work, and call home. Along the way, it began publishing Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), [a searchable and downloadable database](http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/index.html) containing all of its domestic nomenclature. In Alaska alone, the database lists names for 167 dams, 303 post offices, 666 glaciers, 2,704 capes, and 9,575 streams. My favorite: [Confusion Creek](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Confusion+Creek,+Alaska/@68.4510925,-152.0233116,15.94z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x50d80cfac6a29911:0xc46bfa2a83d54866).

**“There’s finally federal data on low-income college graduation rates—but it’s wrong.”** The Hechinger Report [casts doubt on the Pell grant graduation numbers](http://hechingerreport.org/theres-finally-federal-data-on-low-income-college-graduation-rates-but-its-wrong/) contained in the Department of Education’s recently-released [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). Why the discrepancy? “[W]hile schools are required by law to provide the graduation rates of Pell recipients to any applicants who ask, a loophole protects them from having to report the same figures to the government.” Oof.

&nbsp;

**What police-related data does your city publish?** The [Police Open Data Census](https://codeforamerica.github.io/PoliceOpenDataCensus/), created by Code for America fellows in Indianapolis, is tracking “currently available open datasets about police interactions with citizens in the US," including officer-involved shootings, use of force, and citizen complaints. The census currently covers 36 police departments. Related: The NYPD says it will start tracking all officer use-of-force incidents — not just gunfire — next year, [the New York Times reports](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/nyregion/new-york-police-will-document-virtually-all-instances-of-force.html).

**How often do Wikipedia editors edit?** The Wikimedia Foundation has published a dataset enumerating [monthly revision counts for every editor, across all of its wikis](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/09/25/wikipedia-editor-numbers/). The foundation is asking for help investigating a few perplexing trends. For example: Why has the number “very active editors” — those with 100+ edits per month — increased while the number of merely “active” editors has plateaued?

&nbsp;

**Four years of rejected license plates.** WNYC, through a freedom-of-information request to the New York DMV, obtained a list of [vanity plate approvals and denials from late 2010 to late 2014](https://github.com/datanews/license-plates). Among the denials: “RUBMYDUB,” “S5SS5S5S,” “RFLMAO,” and “CBSNEWS.” (Strangely, “NBC4” was approved. Go figure.) The files and [related story](http://www.wnyc.org/story/new-yorkers-vanity-license-plates/) were published in August, but the data are timeless.
