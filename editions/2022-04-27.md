Data Is Plural — 2022.04.27 edition
===================================

*Earmarks, intermediate care facilities, more county-level mortality data, alpine snow, and the meta-Dataverse.*


__Earmarks.__ The US government’s [spending bill for FY 2022](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2471), enacted last month, [heralded the return](https://www.axios.com/congressional-earmarks-new-constraints-44b0551d-bdfc-4e1e-b465-e1d2962c90b7.html) of [earmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earmark_\(politics\)), which were banned for a decade. This time around, Congress [is publishing a set of documents](https://appropriations.house.gov/transparency/fiscal-year-2022) that describe legislators’ specific funding requests — but [as sideways PDFs instead of structured data](https://twitter.com/danielschuman/status/1511322851932000260). So the Bipartisan Policy Center has [converted the PDFs into a spreadsheet](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/congressionally-directed-spending-fy2022-dataset/) listing the 4,975 approved earmarks within them. Bloomberg Government has also [compiled and shared](https://about.bgov.com/news/colleges-cops-airports-among-earmark-winners-in-2022-funding/) a similar spreadsheet. Both files list each earmarked project’s name, recipient, state, and price tag, as well as the legislator(s) who made the request and the subcommittee that approved it; BPC’s file additionally includes the location, agency, agency-account, and legislators’ [Bioguide IDs](https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/member-bioguide-ids).

__Intermediate care facilities.__ In the US, [intermediate care facilities](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certification/CertificationandComplianc/ICFIID) provide residential, long-term care to people whose intellectual or developmental disabilities require active treatment and continuous supervision. On Monday, colleagues at BuzzFeed News published an [investigation into one of the largest ICF owners](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kendalltaggart/kkr-brightspring-disability-private-equity-abuse), supplemented by an [analysis of inspection data](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2022-04-icf-analysis) gathered through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ [QCOR portal](https://qcor.cms.gov/). (Disclosure: I helped to write an initial version of the data-collection code.) The records, [available in bulk](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2022-04-icf-analysis/tree/main/data/qcor) for the first time, [enumerate](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2022-04-icf-analysis#survey-data) surveys conducted between 2010 and 2021, the facilities examined, and the types of deficiencies inspectors found.

__More county-level, COVID-related mortality data.__ The CDC provides [provisional, county-level mortality data for 2018 to the near-present](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html) ([DIP 2021.12.15](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-12-15-edition/)), but requires you to build specific, targeted queries. So researchers at [Documenting COVID-19](https://documentingcovid19.io/) used the agency’s [WONDER API](https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/WONDER-API.html) to gather key stats for every county, such as [breakdowns of deaths](https://github.com/MuckRock/uncounted_data/tree/main/data/race_ethnicity_and_cause_breakdowns) among causes the [CDC says are commonly comorbid with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm), and have [shared them](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2022/apr/04/muckrock-and-the-documenting-covid-19-project/) in a [downloadable repository](https://github.com/MuckRock/uncounted_data).

__Alpine snow.__ [Michael Matiu et al. (2021)](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/15/1343/2021/) compiled a [dataset of daily snowfall and snow depths](https://zenodo.org/record/5109574) at 2,000+ measurement stations in the European Alps, spanning the years 1970 to 2019. They gathered records from open data portals and through requests to authorities in five countries, standardized them into a consistent format, and filled in gaps where possible.

__The meta-Dataverse.__ The [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/) project is [an open-source platform for data sharing](https://dataverse.org/about). (This newsletter has linked to dozens of Dataverse-hosted datasets, mostly on the original [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/).) It [offers an API](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/index.html) for fetching metadata on [each known installation](https://dataverse.org/metrics) and the datasets within them, which project member [Julian Gautier](https://scholar.harvard.edu/juliangautier/home) has been using to assemble and update [bulk snapshots](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DCDKZQ).
