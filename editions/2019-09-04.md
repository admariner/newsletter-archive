*Malaria, CAR refugees, publicly funded patents, drama, and fight songs.*


__Malaria geography.__ The University of Oxford’s [Malaria Atlas Project](https://map.ox.ac.uk/) collects, models, and publishes a [range of datasets](https://map.ox.ac.uk/data-directory/) related to the mosquito-borne disease, including [localized incidence rates](https://map.ox.ac.uk/malaria-burden-data-download/). You can explore and [download](https://map.ox.ac.uk/faq/can-access-gis-data-map/) the data, layer by layer, through [the project’s interactive map](https://map.ox.ac.uk/explorer/).

__CAR refugees.__ The Central African Republic’s [ongoing civil war](https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/violence-central-african-republic) has [pressed more than 600,000 people to flee the country](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/car). The violence has also internally displaced another 600,000 people, a phenomenon that [the UN's Humanitarian Data Exchange has been tracking](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/car-baseline-assessment-data-iom-dtm). In addition to counts of internally displaced people by locality, the UN’s datasets include [a listing of refugee sites](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/car-shapefile-idp-sites) and [the country's road network](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/car-roads-and-paths-shapefile). __Related:__ [A multimedia presentation of one family's 600-kilometer journey in search of safety](https://data.humdata.org/visualization/a-journey-of-600km-car/).

__Publicly funded patents.__ The [3PFL dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3369582) — Patents and Publications with a Public-Funding Linkage — lists more than 13,000 US patents that have acknowledged federal funding. The dataset, accompanied by a [detailed methodology](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218927), also links the patents to details about the funding, as well as to scientific publications that stemmed from it. __Previously:__ [Patent geography](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/OTTBDX) ([DIP 2019.07.31](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-07-31-edition)).

__Drama.__ The [Drama Corpora Project](https://dracor.org/) has collected and processed more than 800 plays in German, Greek, Spanish, Russian, Latin, and English. For each play, the project provides a [structured-data version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative) of the text, a network diagram, speech distribution metrics, plus several other files and features.

__Rah, rah, rah! Fight, fight, fight!__ FiveThirtyEight has built a dataset of [65 college football fight songs](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fight-songs), which contains each song’s name, authors, year written, tempo, duration, and whether it includes various tropes, such as spelling out words or mentioning the school’s colors. __Related:__ FiveThirtyEight’s “[Guide To The Exuberant Nonsense Of College Fight Songs](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/college-fight-song-lyrics/),” where you can listen to the songs, read the lyrics, and explore an interactive chart of tempo versus duration.
