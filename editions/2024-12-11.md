*Quits and layoffs, food safety alerts, crop rotations, Serbian political party funds, and a long-running ultramarathon.*


*üîÑ Last month, PEN America [released](https://pen.org/press-release/nearly-200-percent-surge-in-school-book-bans-during-2023-2024-school-year/) its [latest database of school book bans](https://pen.org/book-bans/pen-america-index-of-school-book-bans-2023-2024/) ([DIP 2022.07.06](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-07-06-edition/)), now covering the 2023‚Äì2024 school year.

__Quits and layoffs.__ Minneapolis Fed‚Äìaffiliated economists [Kathrin Ellieroth](https://sites.google.com/site/kathrinellieroth) and [Amanda Michaud](https://ammichau.github.io/) have [constructed](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/institute-working-papers/quits-layoffs-and-labor-supply) a [new dataset on monthly quits and layoffs](https://sites.google.com/qlmonthly.com/home). Using [Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cps/) (CPS) microdata going back to 1978, the dataset estimates the proportions of employees who, after quitting or being laid off, transition to unemployment versus exiting the labor market. In a [recent article](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2024/where-is-the-us-labor-market-heading-interpreting-the-mixed-signals), Ellieroth and Michaud note that ‚ÄúCPS data offer a perspective not seen in the most-often-used series on quits and layoffs, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS),‚Äù featured in [DIP 2022.09.21](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-09-21-edition/). ‚ÄúWhereas the JOLTS tracks what happens to a *job*, the CPS tracks what happens to *people*.‚Äù Analyzing it, they found ‚Äúthat increases in unemployment are typically *not* due to increases in layoffs; rather, they happen because laid-off workers are less likely to quickly find a new job, more likely to stay in the labor force, and thus more likely to join a growing pool of unemployed people hunting for work.‚Äù [h/t [Alex Albright](https://www.albrightalex.com/)]


__Food safety alerts.__ Data journalist [Adrian Nesta](https://justanesta.com/) is building a [automated pipeline](https://github.com/anesta95/food_safety_recalls) to collect and standardize [data on food safety recalls and alerts](https://github.com/anesta95/food_safety_recalls?tab=readme-ov-file#data-details) from two US federal agencies ‚Äî the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts) and the [USDA](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls). For each alert, the [standardized dataset](https://github.com/anesta95/food_safety_recalls/blob/main/clean_data/food_safety_recalls.json) indicates the notice‚Äôs title, ID, URL, and time posted, as well as the product description, company name, brand name, recall type, recall reason, impacted states, risk level, and [more](https://github.com/anesta95/food_safety_recalls?tab=readme-ov-file#data-dictionary).


__Crop rotations.__ The Department of Agriculture‚Äôs [Crop Sequence Boundaries](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Crop-Sequence-Boundaries/) initiative algorithmically analyzes satellite imagery to create ‚Äúestimates of field boundaries, crop acreage, and crop rotations across the contiguous United States.‚Äù The results are available via an [interactive map](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Crop-Sequence-Boundaries/Viewer/index.php) and downloads for eight-year time frames. The [underlying code is open-source](https://github.com/USDA-REE-NASS/crop-sequence-boundaries) and can be used to generate datasets for custom time frames. __Previously__: The USDA‚Äôs [CropScape tool](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) and [Cropland Data Layer](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/SARS1a.php) ([DIP 2019.03.06](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-03-06-edition/)). [h/t [Forest Gregg](https://bsky.app/profile/bunkum.us)]


__Serbian political party funds.__ The [Center for Investigative Journalism of Serbia](https://www.cins.rs/en/)‚Äôs [Party Funds database](https://www.cins.rs/en/party-funds-database-sns-the-financially-strongest-political-party-in-serbia/) ‚Äútracks all reported incomes and expenses of 40 political parties and citizens‚Äô groups in Serbia over the past nine years.‚Äù The records, based on financial disclosure reports, can be [browsed online](https://www.cins.rs/baze-podataka/stranacka-kasa-2024/), [searched](https://www.cins.rs/baze-podataka/stranacka-kasa-2024/pretrazi-bazu/), and downloaded. They indicate revenues, overhead costs, ad spending, salary expenditures, and more. The data specifies each line item‚Äôs year, amount, purpose, and other context-dependent details.

__A long-running ultramarathon.__ The [Comrades Marathon](https://www.comrades.com/), first run in 1921, [is considered](https://www.comrades.com/about/comrades-museum) ‚Äúthe oldest and largest ultramarathon in the world.‚Äù The route stretches 80+ kilometers between Durban and Pietermaritzburg, flipping annually between ‚Äúup‚Äù and ‚Äúdown‚Äù directions. In 2019, [Kyle Stratton](https://www.kaggle.com/suugaku) scraped the official website to construct a [dataset of all 445,000+ finishers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suugaku/comrades-marathon-results) (year, name, country, club, category, finishing time, medal received) through that year. __Related__: The [Association of Road Racing Statisticians](https://arrs.run/)‚Äô lists of longest-running [marathons](https://arrs.run/LongRunM.htm) and [ultramarathons](https://arrs.run/LongRunUM.htm), last updated in 2017. __As seen in__: [Antony Unwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Unwin)‚Äôs [*Getting (more out of) Graphics*](https://bookdown.org/aatcosada/GmooG-book2/secComM.html).
