Data Is Plural — 2016.01.20 edition
===================================

*Contaminated water, slave ships, campaign ads, Amazon food reviews, and one hyper-quantified human.*


__Flint water samples.__ Researchers from Virginia Tech have joined forces with Flint, Mich., residents to sample the [city’s lead-tainted water supply](http://flintwaterstudy.org/). In December, the researchers posted the [results of 271 samples](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/12/complete-dataset-lead-results-in-tap-water-for-271-flint-samples/), which indicated high levels of lead contamination. The most extreme sample found a lead concentration of 158 parts per billion — 10 times higher than the EPA’s “[action level](http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips/water.htm).” __Related:__ [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/15/us/flint-lead-water-michigan.html) + [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/15/this-is-how-toxic-flints-water-really-is/) have used the data.


__The transatlantic slave trade.__ Slate Magazine’s “[The Atlantic Slave Trade in Two Minutes](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_history_of_american_slavery/2015/06/animated_interactive_of_the_history_of_the_atlantic_slave_trade.html)” — [recently named a multimedia finalist](https://twitter.com/ASME1963/status/687734147067031552) for the American Society of Magazine Editors’ annual awards — tracks 20,528 transatlantic voyages over 315 years. The information comes via [SlaveVoyages.org](http://slavevoyages.org/), which provides [searchable](http://slavevoyages.org/voyage/search), [downloadable](http://slavevoyages.org/voyage/download) records of ships’ and captains’ names, regions where slaves were purchased and sent, and more.


__Campaign ad purchases.__ The [FCC requires](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/73.1943) broadcasters to keep records of “all requests for broadcast time made by or on behalf of a candidate for public office.” With the help of volunteers, [Political Ad Sleuth](http://politicaladsleuth.com/) gathers those records and enters them into a [searchable, downloadable database](http://politicaladsleuth.com/political-files/most-recent/). __Note:__ Due, in part, to the difficulty of transcribing the (non-standardized) records, the information in the database is incomplete.


__568,454 reviews of “fine foods” on Amazon.__ In 2013, Stanford University researchers published a paper examining how people’s tastes “change and evolve over time.” They drew, in part, on a [dataset containing 13 years of Amazon reviews of gourmet foods](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html). (Note: [Not all foods](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001E4KFG0) were intended for humans.) The dataset comes in a slightly unconventional format; [here’s a Python script to convert it to a TSV file](https://gist.github.com/jsvine/57679826ed582a95dd71). [h/t [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews%20)]


__One hyper-quantified human.__ Last month, [Nature Communications published a study](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151209/ncomms9885/full/ncomms9885.html) of the “long-term neural and physiological phenotyping of a single human.” That human? Study co-author Russell A. Poldrack, “a right-handed Caucasian male, aged 45 years at the onset of the study.” The 18 months of results — tracking brain connections, food consumption, stress levels, and much more — are [available to download](http://results.myconnectome.org/) and [explore](http://results.myconnectome.org/explore).
