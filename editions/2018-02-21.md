Data Is Plural — 2018.02.21 edition
===================================

*Rohingya refugees, Treasury sanctions, happy moments, GitHub activity, and public commemorations.*


__Rohingya refugees.__ The Humanitarian Data Exchange has collated [dozens of datasets related to the Rohingya refugee crisis](https://data.humdata.org/event/rohingya-displacement). Among them: [the geographic boundaries of Rohingya refugee settlements in Bangladesh](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/outline-of-camps-sites-of-rohingya-refugees-in-cox-s-bazar-bangladesh), [the numbers of refugees living in those settlements](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/site-location-of-rohingya-refugees-in-cox-s-bazar), and [the infrastructure available there](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cox-s-bazar-refugee-settlement-infrastructure).


__U.S. Treasury sanctions.__ Through its [Office of Foreign Assets Control](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Pages/default.aspx), the Treasury publishes several datasets that describe the people and companies subject to U.S. economic sanctions. The two main listings are the [Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/Other-OFAC-Sanctions-Lists.aspx) (“SDN”) and the [Consolidated Sanctions List](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/consolidated.aspx). Those contain only currently-sanctioned entities, but the Treasury also publishes (semi-structured) documents describing historical additions and removals. __Related:__ [Enigma Public’s Sanctions Tracker](https://labs.enigma.com/sanctions-tracker/).

__Happy moments.__ [HappyDB](https://rit-public.github.io/HappyDB/) is “a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments.” An example: “My son gave me a big hug in the morning when I woke him up.” The researchers, who recently [described their efforts in an academic paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07746), collected the sentiments from Mechanical Turk workers, who also supplied basic demographic information, such as age, gender, and whether they have children.

__Seven years of GitHub activity.__ The [GitHub Archive](https://www.githubarchive.org/) is an effort to record the popular code-sharing website’s public timeline, “archive it, and make it easily accessible for further analysis.” The dataset, which includes [more than 20 types of events](http://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/) and often contains more than 1 million events per day, goes back to February 2011. __Related:__ [Structured data representing the “commit histories” of two dozen popular open-source projects](https://github.com/gitential/datasets), including Rust, Pandas, Redis, and Bitcoin.


__Public commemorations.__ The [Open Plaques](http://openplaques.org/) project is dedicated to “documenting the historical links between people and places as recorded by commemorative plaques.” The [latest data dump](http://openplaques.org/data) contains nearly 40,000 plaques — the vast majority in the U.S., U.K., and Germany. [OpenBenches](https://openbenches.org/), meanwhile, has collected [similar data](https://github.com/edent/openbenches) for 4,300+ memorial benches.
