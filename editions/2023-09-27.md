Data Is Plural — 2023.09.27 edition
===================================

*Linked historical censuses, fracking fluids, Europopulism, GitHub metrics, and ancient places.* 


__Censuses, linked.__ The [Census Tree](https://www.censustree.org/), developed by [Kasey Buckles et al.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31671), “is the largest-ever database of record links among the historical U.S. censuses, with over 700 million links for people living in the United States between 1850 and 1940.” By the [team](https://www.censustree.org/our-team)’s [estimates](https://sites.google.com/nd.edu/censustreefaq), the dataset “includes over 70% of the possible links that *could* be made for men, and over 60% of possible links for women.” To build it, the researchers [began](https://www.censustree.org/methodology) with genealogy records from [FamilySearch.org](https://www.familysearch.org/), developed a machine learning algorithm to identify additional links, and incorporated data from other census-linking projects. Each Census Tree row connects an individual’s [IPUMS identifier](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/HISTID) in one decade’s census to their identifier in another. Per the project’s [instructions](https://www.censustree.org/quickstart), you’ll need to download the Census data itself [from IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/full_count.shtml).


__Fracking fluids.__ Since [launching in 2011](https://www.fracfocus.org/learn/about-fracfocus), [FracFocus](https://fracfocus.org/) has become the largest registry of [hydraulic fracturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking) chemical disclosures in the US. The database, available to explore online and [download in bulk](https://fracfocus.org/data-download), contains 210,000+ such disclosures from fracking operators; it details the location, timing, and water volume of each fracking job, plus the names and amounts of chemicals used. The project is [managed](https://fracfocus.org/about-us) by the [Ground Water Protection Council](https://www.gwpc.org/overview/), “a nonprofit 501(c)6 organization whose members consist of state ground water regulatory agencies”. __As seen in__: The [latest installment](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/25/climate/fracking-oil-gas-wells-water.html) of the New York Times’ [Uncharted Water series](https://www.nytimes.com/series/uncharted-waters).


__Europopulism.__ [The PopuList](https://popu-list.org/), constructed by [Matthijs Rooduijn et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/populist-a-database-of-populist-farleft-and-farright-parties-using-expertinformed-qualitative-comparative-classification-eiqcc/EBF60489A0E1E3D91A6FE066C7ABA2CA), “offers academics and journalists an overview of populist, far-left and far-right parties in Europe from 1989 until 2022.” [Version 3.0 of the dataset](https://osf.io/2ewkq/), released last month, lists each party’s country, local/English names, presence in parliament, and identifiers in the [Party Facts](https://partyfacts.herokuapp.com/) ([DIP 2019.01.16](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-01-16-edition/)) and [ParlGov](https://www.parlgov.org/) ([DIP 2018.09.19](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-09-19-edition/)) databases. It also indicates whether the project’s [comparativists and country experts](https://popu-list.org/about/) classified the party (outright or “borderline”) as populist, far-right, far-left, and/or [euroskeptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism), and for which time periods.


__GitHub metrics.__ GitHub’s new [Innovation Graph](https://innovationgraph.github.com/) datasets present a range of quarterly metrics on the code-sharing site, aggregated by “economy” — a concept similar to “country” but slightly broader. (Antarctica is an “economy” in the data, for example.) The [datasets](https://github.com/github/innovationgraph) count the number of developers based in each economy, their repositories and [code pushes](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push), most-used programming languages, and more. As noted in the project’s [datasheet](https://github.com/github/innovationgraph/blob/main/docs/datasheet.md), the locations are based on IP addresses, so [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VPN_service) usage may distort the results. __Previously__: [More-granular GitHub activity via the GH Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/) ([DIP 2018.02.21](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-02-21-edition/)).

__Ancient places.__ [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/), “a community-built gazetteer and graph of ancient places,” has collected [data](https://pleiades.stoa.org/downloads) on [40,000+](https://pleiades.stoa.org/home) settlements, roads, rivers, monuments, and many other [types of landmarks](https://pleiades.stoa.org/vocabularies/place-types). It also describes the [relationships](https://pleiades.stoa.org/vocabularies/relationship-types) between them — linking, for instance, the [Parthenon](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/168254096) to the [Acropolis](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/638356144) and the Acropolis to [Athens](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579885). __Related__: [ORBIS: The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World](https://orbis.stanford.edu/). __Previously__: [Roman amphitheaters](https://github.com/roman-amphitheaters/roman-amphitheaters) ([DIP 2022.06.08](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-06-08-edition/)) and the [Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilizations](https://darmc.harvard.edu/) ([DIP 2020.06.24](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-06-24-edition/)).
