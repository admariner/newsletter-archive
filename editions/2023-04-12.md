Let me know by responding to this email or by [filling out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXXD5eO05w0Xa7bwG3Ppia3uzr_o3y-xDEZuWRfXbCfCu_XA/viewform). I‚Äôll aim to share your work here and via DIP‚Äôs new [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@dataisplural) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dataisplural/) accounts.*


__Jail rosters.__ The [NYU Public Safety Lab](https://publicsafetylab.org/)‚Äôs [Jail Data Initiative](https://jaildatainitiative.org/) has [built](https://jaildatainitiative.org/documentation/architecture) a [fleet of web scrapers](https://jaildatainitiative.org/documentation/scrapers) to gather and process [daily roster data from 1,000+ US city and county jails](https://jaildatainitiative.org/documentation/about). The project‚Äôs [aggregate metrics](https://jaildatainitiative.org/dashboards/population) include the number of people in these jails each day, the daily numbers of people newly incarcerated and released, and how long people have been held (among those released). You can filter and download these counts by age, gender, and race. [Profiles of individual jails](https://jaildatainitiative.org/profile) also list the most common charges and the overall demographics of people held there. The time frames available vary by jail, but mostly begin in 2020 or 2021. You can also [apply for access](https://jaildatainitiative.org/dua) to person-level records.

__Sanctions enforcement.__ Political scientists [Bryan R. Early](https://sites.google.com/site/bryanrearly/home) and [Keith A. Preble](https://poliscikeith.com/) have [assembled](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2020.1722850) a [dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/TIFRTT) of the US [Office of Foreign Assets Control](https://ofac.treasury.gov/)‚Äôs sanctions-related penalties, settlements, and findings of violation since 2003. To do so, they [combed through](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=6988628&version=5.1) the agency‚Äôs [mostly-PDF-based archive of these enforcement actions](https://ofac.treasury.gov/civil-penalties-and-enforcement-information). Each of the dataset‚Äôs 1,000+ entries indicates the action date, type, and monetary amount; entity name, type, location, and sector; the specific sanctions programs violated; and more. __Previously__: [OFAC‚Äôs sanctions lists](https://ofac.treasury.gov/other-ofac-sanctions-lists) ([DIP 2018.02.21](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-02-21-edition/)) and [OpenSanctions](https://opensanctions.org/) ([DIP 2021.09.08](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-09-08-edition/)).


__Border surveillance.__ The [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/about) has [constructed](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/cbp-expanding-its-surveillance-tower-program-us-mexico-border-and-were-mapping-it) a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?mid=1bxUGeOT6vVXu0jFQhDLxgktLFLVOKsI&ll=29.681163559249427,-107.321836295&z=5) and [dataset](https://www.eff.org/document/us-mexico-border-surveillance-data) of 340+ Customs and Border Protection surveillance towers along the US-Mexico border. ‚ÄúCompiled using public records, satellite imagery, road trips, and even exploration in virtual reality,‚Äù the dataset indicates each tower‚Äôs location, name, type, and vendor; it also links to sources and satellite imagery. Separate entries list potential future towers proposed by CBP and [automated license plate readers](https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-readers-alpr) at CBP checkpoints.

__Flash flooding in urban England.__ [ClimateNode](https://www.climatenode.org/index.html)‚Äôs [Helen Jackson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-jackson-28926285/) has created a [dataset and series of interactive maps](https://www.climatenode.org/maps/about_UFF_maps.html) of recent summertime flash flooding in urban England. To [construct the dataset](https://www.climatenode.org/maps/UFFEdoc.pdf), Jackson ‚Äúanalysed approximately 17,400 articles about flooding from around 300 newspaper websites,‚Äù and then used [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) to ‚Äúextract the names of streets, buildings and other places affected‚Äù ‚Äî some 2,800+ locations in all, corresponding to 56 flooding events since 2010.

__Dutch textile shipments.__ The [Dutch Textile Trade Project](https://dutchtextiletrade.org/) ‚Äúaims to understand the circulation of globally-sourced textiles on Dutch ships around the world in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by examining data drawn from trade records alongside samples of textiles and visual culture depicting textiles in use.‚Äù The 22,000+ entries in the project‚Äôs [main dataset](https://dutchtextiletrade.org/data/) each represent a shipment from one port to another; they indicate the textile type, quantity, and value, shipment date, supplier, and more.
