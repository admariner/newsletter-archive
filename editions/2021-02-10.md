Data Is Plural — 2021.02.10 edition
===================================

*Hyperlocal Biden/Trump results, subnational COVID-19 vaccinations, historical night light, public-sector employment, and Super Bowl ads.*

&nbsp;

**Hyperlocal Biden/Trump results.** To create their “[Extremely Detailed Map of the 2020 Election](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/upshot/2020-election-map.html),” journalists at The Upshot have gathered and standardized the ballot results for more than 100,000 precincts in dozens of states so far — representing nearly two-thirds of all votes cast. The accompanying [GeoJSON dataset](https://github.com/TheUpshot/presidential-precinct-map-2020) indicates the number of votes received by Joe Biden, by Donald Trump, and overall (including third-party and write-in candidates), joined to each precinct’s geographic boundaries.

**Subnational COVID-19 vaccinations.** Software developer [Lucas Rodés-Guirao](https://lcsrg.me/) is aggregating [coronavirus vaccination numbers, over time, by administrative division](https://github.com/sociepy/covid19-vaccination-subnational) — each canton in Switzerland, for example, and each province in Argentina. The project, inspired by [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)’s [country-level dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations) ([DIP 2020.12.23](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-12-23-edition)), currently includes 20+ countries and provides links to the sources.

**Historical night light.** Researchers [have harmonized](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0510-y) two major datasets measuring the light visible on Earth at night. The first, from the [Defense Meteorological Satellite Program](https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Operations/DMSP/index.html), [covers 1992–2013](https://eogdata.mines.edu/dmsp/downloadV4composites.html). The second, from the [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite](https://www.jpss.noaa.gov/viirs.html), [covers 2012 onward](https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/vnl/). The [harmonized dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/Harmonization_of_DMSP_and_VIIRS_nighttime_light_data_from_1992-2018_at_the_global_scale/9828827/2) covers 1992–2018 and polishes the data by removing, for example, “noises from aurora, fires, boasts, and other temporal lights.” **Related**: [The Colorado School of Mines’ Earth Observation Group](https://payneinstitute.mines.edu/eog/), which “specializes in nighttime observations of lights and combustion sources worldwide.” [h/t [Milos Popovic](https://twitter.com/milos_agathon/status/1358832472348327936)]

&nbsp;

**Public-sector employment.** The World Bank’s [Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/worldwide-bureaucracy-indicators) “is a unique new cross-national dataset on public sector employment and wages” in 130+ countries between 2000 and 2018, based on censuses and household surveys. The dataset’s measurements include the size of this workforce, its demographics, pay disparities versus the private sector, and more. **Related**: [An introductory Twitter thread from coauthor Faisal Baig](https://twitter.com/faisalabaig/status/1356326936448917507).

&nbsp;

**Super Bowl ads.** Journalists at FiveThirtyEight [watched 233 Super Bowl ads](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/super-bowl-ads/) run by 10 frequently-advertising brands between 2000 and 2020, drawing from [superbowl-ads.com](https://superbowl-ads.com/)’s video archive. Then they [categorized each ad](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/superbowl-ads) according to seven specific questions, which included “Was it trying to be funny?” and “Did it include animals?”
