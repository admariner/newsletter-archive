Data Is Plural — 2023.05.17 edition
===================================

*Controlled substances lost and stolen, international case law, ICE database misconduct, real effective exchange rates, and collective nouns.*


__Controlled substances lost and stolen.__ In response to a [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/) Freedom of Information Act [request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/controlled-substance-theft-and-loss/), the US Drug Enforcement Administration last week sent me [data counting the thefts and other losses](https://github.com/data-liberation-project/dea-theft-and-loss-counts) of [controlled substances](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/) and “[listed chemicals](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/chem_prog/34chems.htm)” that regulated entities have reported to the agency. The DEA [provided the records](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/dea-theft-and-loss-counts/) as [two spreadsheet files](https://github.com/data-liberation-project/dea-theft-and-loss-counts/tree/main/data/raw), which I’ve also [converted into tidy CSVs](https://github.com/data-liberation-project/dea-theft-and-loss-counts/tree/main/data/tidy). They indicate the number of incidents by state, type of business (pharmacy, importer, distributor, etc.), and type of loss (burglary, hijacking, natural disaster, etc.), plus the total quantities stolen/lost. __Read more__: [Yesterday’s Data Liberation Project newsletter](https://buttondown.email/data-liberation-project/archive/dlp-dispatch-8/), featuring some numbers that caught my eye.


__International case law.__ “The quantitative analysis of international legal data is still in its infancy, a situation which is exacerbated by the lack of high-quality open access data sets,” writes [Seán Fobbe](https://seanfobbe.com/) in a [2022 paper in Journal of Empirical Legal Studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12313). To this end, Fobbe’s “present[s] the first two of a new series” of such resources, “covering one hundred years of case law of the primary judicial organs of the United Nations and the League of Nations.” The datasets — [for the Permanent Court of International Justice](https://zenodo.org/record/7051934) (covering 1922–1940) and [for the International Court of Justice](https://zenodo.org/record/7876286) (1947–present) — include case metadata, linguistic metrics, and the full text (in English and French) of the courts’ opinions, orders, and other key documents.


__ICE database misconduct.__ “Since 2016, hundreds of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees and contractors have faced internal investigations into abuse of confidential law enforcement databases and agency computers,” [Dhruv Mehrotra reports in Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agent-database-abuse-records/), based on [disciplinary database records](https://airtable.com/shrodU77cgvD2e8dc/tblwELYkSA0fNXgKF) Mehrotra obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. ICE provided 414 rows of records. Each represents an alleged misconduct incident and provides a summary, date of occurrence, date reported, location, several categorizations, case resolution, and more. Wired has also added a column identifying the database in question, based on the summary.

__Weighted, inflation-adjusted exchange rates.__ A country’s [real effective exchange rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reer.asp) is its average exchange rate with its trading partners, weighted by trade volume and adjusted for inflation. Economist [Zsolt Darvas](https://www.bruegel.org/people/zsolt-darvas) maintains a [dataset](https://www.bruegel.org/publications/datasets/real-effective-exchange-rates-for-178-countries-a-new-database) that [estimates](https://www.bruegel.org/working-paper/timely-measurement-real-effective-exchange-rates) these rates for 178 countries and the eurozone, by month and year. The project, which updates a [dataset and methodology Darvas first published in 2012](https://www.bruegel.org/working-paper/real-effective-exchange-rates-178-countries-new-database), uses data from international organizations, national statistics offices, and central banks.


__Collective nouns.__ [Daniel E. Meyers](https://sites.miamioh.edu/meyersde/) has consulted dozens of sources to compile [The Collective Noun Catalog](https://sites.miamioh.edu/meyersde/the-collective-noun-catalog/), which presents an *inundation* of 7,300+ such constructs, such as a *pulse* of cardiologists and a *warren* of wombats. The [project’s spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xCYrcJYhZVHNaF2J5oIgiFsROF--ZDzl68VFS8HzNUQ/edit) lists each collective noun’s subject, category, notes, and primary sources — some of which date to the 1400s.
