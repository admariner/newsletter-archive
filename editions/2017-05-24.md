===================================

*America‚Äôs card catalog, domestic radicalization, ransomware payments, 50 million doodles, and canned beer.*


__America‚Äôs card catalog.__ Last week, the Library of Congress [released its largest dataset ever](https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-068/): nearly 25 million records for books, maps, manuscripts and other items in its online catalog. For each item, the data includes standardized bibliographic information, such as the title, author, publication date, and genre. (The dataset represents the online catalog as it was in 2013; more recent data will [cost you](http://www.loc.gov/cds/PDFdownloads/mds2016.pdf).) __Related:__ [A bit of background about the library‚Äôs MARC (Machine Readable Cataloging Records) data format](https://opensource.com/article/17/4/bit-about-marc-handlers).


__Domestic radicalization.__ The [Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States](http://www.start.umd.edu/data-tools/profiles-individual-radicalization-united-states-pirus) (PIRUS) database ‚Äúcontains deidentified individual-level information on the backgrounds, attributes, and radicalization processes of nearly 1,500 violent and non-violent extremists who adhere to far right, far left, Islamist, or single issue ideologies in the United States‚Äù ‚Äî including the Klu Klux Klan, the Taliban, and the Animal Liberation Front, among others. The dataset covers 1948 through 2013 and was [released earlier this year](http://www.start.umd.edu/news/profiles-individual-radicalization-united-states-pirus-data-now-available) by a team at the University of Maryland.

__Ransomware payments.__ When the malware program known as ‚ÄúWannaCry‚Äù hit hundreds of thousands of computers earlier this month, it demanded that the computers‚Äô owners pay $300 in Bitcoin ‚Äî or lose all of their data. [Keith Collins](http://keithcollins.github.io/) at Quartz has been using [Blockchain‚Äôs API](https://blockchain.info/api) to track Bitcoin payments to the three digital wallets that the hackers designated to receive the ransoms. He‚Äôs [published the data](https://github.com/keithcollins/actual_ransom) and is also using it to power [a Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/actual_ransom). __Related:__ ‚Äú[Victims of the WannaCry ransomware attacks have stopped paying up](https://qz.com/986094/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-victims-have-stopped-paying-the-ransom/)‚Äù and ‚Äú[Inside the digital heist that terrorized the world‚Äîand only made $100k](https://qz.com/985093/inside-the-digital-heist-that-terrorized-the-world-and-made-less-than-100k/),‚Äù both by Collins. __Previously:__ [Historical Bitcoin prices](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-03-08-edition) (DIP 2017.03.08).


__Fifty million doodles.__ Google is clever: It created a [drawing game](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data), got 15 million people to play it, and then turned those doodles into into a public dataset of people drawing. You can [download the raw data](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset), or just [browse the doodles online](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data).


__üé∂ Two thousand cans of craft beer on the wall üé∂.__ The website [CraftCans.com](http://www.craftcans.com/) publishes a [database of 2,000+ canned beers](http://craftcans.com/db.php?search=all&sort=beerid&ord=desc&view=text). For each beer, the database lists its name, style, brewery, size, alcohol level, and bitterness. The website doesn‚Äôt provide a direct download, but ‚Äî [as Jean-Nicholas Hould points out](http://www.jeannicholashould.com/python-web-scraping-tutorial-for-craft-beers.html) ‚Äî you can basically just copy-paste the website‚Äôs data into your favorite spreadsheet program. Or, if you want something slightly cleaner, you can use [this script](https://gist.github.com/jsvine/c537ac9509e7d0ed713cced4992faf39). __Related:__ [This data-profiling tutorial by Hould](http://www.jeannicholashould.com/profiling-a-dataset-of-craft-beers.html), which uses the data. __Also related:__ [RateBeer.com‚Äôs API](https://www.ratebeer.com/json/ratebeerapi.asp), but you‚Äôll need to request a developer key to use it. __Plus:__ [This interactive graphic](https://pudding.cool/2017/04/beer/), which uses the RateBeer data to explore America‚Äôs microbrew epicenters. __And also:__ [Official brewery production stats](https://www.ttb.gov/beer/beer-stats.shtml) from the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.
