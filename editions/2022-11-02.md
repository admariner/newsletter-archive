__Nuclear stockpiles.__ As of early 2022, a total of nine countries possessed approximately 12,700 nuclear warheads, according to [estimates from the Federation of American Scientists](https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/). Although ‚Äúthe exact number of nuclear weapons in each country‚Äôs possession is a closely held national secret,‚Äù the researchers say that ‚Äúpublicly available information, careful analysis of historical records, and occasional leaks‚Äù make the estimates possible, albeit ‚Äúwith significant uncertainty.‚Äù The report includes each country‚Äôs current warhead count and subtotals by status, as well as annual totals for each country since 1945. __As seen in__: [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons). __Previously__: Nuclear [capabilities](http://www.matthewfuhrmann.com/datasets.html) ([DIP 2016.02.24](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-02-24-edition/)) and [explosions](https://github.com/data-is-plural/nuclear-explosions) ([DIP 2016.03.23](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-03-23-edition/)).

__Decades of river widths.__ [Dongmei Feng et al.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021WR031712) have applied an algorithmic approach to calculating the [widths of the world‚Äôs largest rivers over time](https://zenodo.org/record/6425657#.Y2AxIILMI-Q). Their dataset contains more than 1 billion measurements of 2.7 million fluvial cross-sections (focusing on those wider than 90 meters), based on 1.2 million satellite images captured between 1984 and 2020. __Previously__: [Free-flowing rivers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1111-9) ([DIP 2019.07.24](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-07-24-edition/)) and [US hydrography](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset) ([DIP 2022.10.12](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-10-12-edition/)).

__Flood insurance changes.__  FEMA [recently revamped](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/risk-rating) its method of pricing US flood insurance, aiming for ‚Äúrates that are actuarily sound, equitable, easier to understand and better reflect a property‚Äôs flood risk.‚Äù A [series of datasets and dashboards](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/risk-rating/profiles) from the agency summarize the expected changes in premiums, which began taking effect last year. They count the number of policies for which monthly payments were projected to increase/decrease by a given amount, bucketed into ten-dollar increments, for each state, county, and ZIP code. __As seen in__: ‚Äú[How have flood insurance premiums changed?](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-have-flood-insurance-premiums-changed/)‚Äù (USAFacts).


__The weight of the web.__ Researchers at the [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/), a project of the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), ‚Äúperiodically crawl the top sites on the web and record detailed information about fetched resources, used web platform APIs and features, and execution traces of each page.‚Äù They make the raw data [available via Google BigQuery](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/httparchive.org/blob/main/docs/gettingstarted_bigquery.md), and also publish [aggregate data](https://httparchive.org/reports) tracking metrics such as [loading speed](https://httparchive.org/reports/loading-speed) and [page weight](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight) (measured in kilobytes transferred). __As seen in__: ‚Äú[Why web pages can have a size problem](https://blog.datawrapper.de/why-web-pages-can-have-a-size-problem/)‚Äù (Datawrapper).


__Swiss apartment layouts.__ [Swiss Dwellings](https://zenodo.org/record/7215005) ‚Äúcontains detailed data on over 42,500 apartments (250,000 rooms) in ~3,100 buildings including their geometries, room typology as well as their visual, acoustical, topological and daylight characteristics,‚Äù collected by [Archilyse AG](https://www.archilyse.com/), a company that analyzes building plans. The details include the placement of rooms, features (e.g., sinks and bathtubs), walls, windows, doors, and more.
