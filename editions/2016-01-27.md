Data Is Plural — 2016.01.27 edition
===================================

*Airplane safety, cancer rates, movie ratings, federal employees’ feelings, and Scots accused of witchcraft.*


__Airplane confidential.__ NASA [collects aviation safety reports](http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/index.html) from pilots, technicians, flight attendants, and other personnel. The (anonymized) published data contains text narratives, as well as details about flight conditions and other safety factors. (“Ok, I did it; the dumbest thing I have ever done in my entire life,” one confessional begins.) You can [search the database](http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/search/database.html) but can only download so many records at a time. And you can [request the full database from NASA](http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/search/requesting.html), but you’ll have to wait. An alternative option: [There’s a copy from November on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/download/asrs-extracted.tar).

__Cancer statistics.__ Earlier this month, the American Cancer Society launched a [new data dashboard](http://cancerstatisticscenter.cancer.org/). Metrics include [estimated new cases](http://cancerstatisticscenter.cancer.org/#/data-analysis/NewCaseEstimates), [historical survival rates](http://cancerstatisticscenter.cancer.org/#/data-analysis/SurvivalByStage), and more. To download the corresponding spreadsheets, use the “tools” button on each page. [h/t [Virginia Hughes](https://twitter.com/virginiahughes)]


__Tens of millions of movie ratings.__ [MovieLens.org](https://movielens.org/) is a free, noncommercial movie recommender — sort of like Netflix, minus the ability to watch movies. The service is run by a [research lab at the University of Minnesota](http://grouplens.org/). The lab publishes [several datasets of user ratings and movie info](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). The largest contains 22 million ratings. Among movies with at least 1,000 ratings, *The Shawshank Redemption* has received the highest average score (4.44 of 5), while 2007’s *[Epic Movie](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/epic_movie/)* has netted the lowest (1.48 of 5).


__Federal employees’ feelings.__ Last year, more than 400,000 federal employees took the [Office of Personnel Management’s annual survey](http://www.fedview.opm.gov/2015/), which includes questions about satisfaction, leadership, and work schedules. You can download [aggregate](http://www.fedview.opm.gov/2015/Reports/) and [raw results](http://www.fedview.opm.gov/2015/EVSDATA/). Important note: The survey is voluntary and non-random.


__The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft.__ The University of Edinburgh hosts an incredibly detailed, and deeply documented database of [more than 3,000 accused witches in Scotland](http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Research/witches/). The mania reached its quantitative peak in 1662, when, [according to the database](http://webdb.ucs.ed.ac.uk/witches/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.graph2), 402 people were accused of witchcraft.
