===================================

*US coronavirus case details, high-resolution population densities, electoral gender quotas, EU merger decisions, and dried beans.*


__US coronavirus case details.__ Last week, the US CDC began publishing a [new, geographically-specific COVID-19 “case surveillance” dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4). Each of the 22 million rows represents a ([de-identified](https://github.com/CDCgov/covid_case_privacy_review)) coronavirus case, accounting for roughly 70% of the country’s current official case count. The details include (where available) the person’s county and state of residence; age, sex, race, and ethnicity; “presence of any underlying medical conditions and risk behaviors”; and whether the person was hospitalized and/or died. __Read more__: [Betsy Ladyzhets writes at the COVID-19 Data Dispatch](https://coviddatadispatch.com/2021/03/28/new-more-local-data-from-the-cdc/), “After months of no state-by-state demographic data from the federal government, we now have county-by-county demographic data. This is a pretty big deal!"


__High-resolution population densities.__ “Using a mixture of machine learning techniques, high-resolution satellite imagery, and population data,” [researchers at Facebook and Columbia University](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/mapping-the-world-to-help-aid-workers-with-weakly-semi-supervised-learning) have “mapped hundreds of millions of structures distributed across vast areas and then used that to extrapolate the local population density.” The [project](https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/population-density-maps/), which [began half a decade ago](https://engineering.fb.com/2016/02/21/core-data/connecting-the-world-with-better-maps/), now provides [population density datasets](https://data.humdata.org/search?organization=facebook&q=%22high%20resolution%20population%20density%22) covering much of the world. (China, Russia, and Canada are among the notable countries missing.) __Read more__: [Benjamin Schmidt’s exploratory Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/benmschmidt/status/1369718224997220362). __Previously__: [The Global Human Settlement Layer](https://ghslsys.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php) ([DIP 2016.11.02](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-11-02-edition/)).


__Electoral gender quotas.__ Many countries apply [gender quotas](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/quotas) to their parliamentary elections, typically by reserving a certain number of seats for women or by regulating political parties’ candidate lists. In other instances, parties have instituted voluntary quotas. The [Gender Quotas Database](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas) categorizes these rules [for more than 120 nations](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/database), and provides additional details through its country profile pages.


__EU merger decisions.__ [Pauline Affeldt et al.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3366915) have compiled a [quarter century of merger control decisions](https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.670982.en/pages/research_data_center_for_business_and_organizational_data__rdc-bo.html) by the European Commission’s [Directorate-General for Competition](https://ec.europa.eu/dgs/competition/index_en.htm) — decisions relating to 5,000+ cases and 31,000+ product/market combinations between 1990 and 2014. The dataset lists the target company, acquiring company, industry, product, outcome, decision date, and more. [h/t [Anna Rita Bennato](https://twitter.com/AnnaRBennato/status/1367803357314813952)]


__Dried beans.__ Researchers at Turkey’s [Selçuk University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sel%C3%A7uk_University) have [built](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168169919311573) a computer vision program to measure and classify images of dried beans. Their [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset) includes 13,611 specimens across seven varieties; for each, it reports the bean’s perimeter, axis lengths, roundness, and more.
