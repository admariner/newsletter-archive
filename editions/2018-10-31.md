Data Is Plural — 2018.10.31 edition
===================================

*Bridges, foreign influence campaigns on Twitter, electric utilities, coal cleanup funds, and probably-fake political committees.*


__Bridges.__ The Federal Highway Administration’s [National Bridge Inventory](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi.cfm) contains detailed data on more than 600,000 “highway bridges” in the United States. The inventory [goes back to 1992](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/ascii.cfm) and contains scores of fields, including the bridge’s age, condition, design, and materials. __Now you know:__ Texas has the most highway bridges in the inventory, with more than 53,800. __Bonus:__ You can also search the bridges via the unofficial [BridgeReports.com](https://bridgereports.com/). __Related:__ [The code](https://github.com/baltimore-sun-data/bridge-data) the Baltimore Sun used to answer the question, “[How safe are Maryland's bridges?](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-bridge-collapse-maryland-20180815-story.html)” [h/t [Christine Zhang](https://twitter.com/christinezhang)]


__Foreign influence campaigns on Twitter.__ [Earlier this month](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/enabling-further-research-of-information-operations-on-twitter.html), Twitter released [data on the public activity](https://about.twitter.com/en_us/values/elections-integrity.html#data) of “3,841 accounts affiliated with the [Internet Research Agency], originating in Russia, and 770 other accounts, potentially originating in Iran.” Together, the datasets “include more than 10 million Tweets and more than 2 million images, GIFs, videos, and Periscope broadcasts.” __Related:__ My colleague Peter Aldhous used this data — combined with [data on 3 million “Russian troll tweets” released this summer](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-sharing-3-million-russian-troll-tweets/) by Clemson University researchers and FiveThirtyEight — to examine [the Internet Research Agency’s traction before and after the 2016 election](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/russia-online-trolls-viral-strategy). __Bonus:__ [Peter’s code](https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2018-10-russian-troll-tweets/).


__Electric utilities.__ The U.S. Energy Information Administration uses Form EIA-861 to collect [annual data from thousands of electric utilities](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/) about their sales, revenue, peak loads, customer counts, energy efficiency savings, and more. More than 3,400 utilities submitted the form (or its shorter cousin, EIA-861S) for 2017, and the data go back to 1990. [h/t [Jordan Wirfs-Brock](http://www.jordanwb.com/)]


__Coal cleanup funds.__ What happens when coal mines shut down? Money for their cleanup is supposed to be ensured by a system of bonds. But when Climate Home News’ Mark Olalde [investigated](http://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/03/15/investigated-coal-industrys-clean-funds/) these remediation funds, [he found](http://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/03/14/us-coal-hasnt-set-aside-enough-money-clean-mines/) “a system incapable of dealing with large-scale bankruptcies, amid a declining industry, which severely threatens the environment and future of coal-mining communities across the country.” You can [download the data behind Olalde’s findings](http://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/03/15/us-coal-mines-clean-up-bonds-database/) — including bond databases covering the “23 states that produce 99% of US coal,” obtained via public records requests.

__Probably-fake political committees.__ When the Federal Election Commission receives a registration form that contains “questionable information” from a candidate or committee, the agency asks for additional information. If the FEC doesn’t get a proper response, it adds the registration to its [dataset of “unverified filers”](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=filings). Among the 500+ registrations currently on the list: “VoldemortCantStopTheVote.org”, “Department of Treasury,” “Wookie PAC,” and “Al Pacino.” [h/t [Chris Zubak-Skees](https://twitter.com/zubakskees)]
