__Inmate call costs.__ In its latest ‚Äú[State of Phone Justice](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/phones/state_of_phone_justice_2022.html)‚Äù report, the [Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/) has compiled [data on the price of inmate phone calls](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/phones/state_of_phone_justice_2022.html#appendices) ‚Äúfor almost every jail and prison in the country.‚Äù [One table](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/phones/appendices2022_3.html) lists each jail‚Äôs name, state, type, average daily population, telecom company, and the per-minute cost of in-state and out-of-state calls in 2021. As the [report‚Äôs methodology](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/phones/state_of_phone_justice_2022.html#methodology) explains, those figures are based on [forms that telecom providers must submit](https://www.fcc.gov/general/ics-data-collections) to the Federal Communications Commission, with ‚Äúadditional corrections and updates based on our research.‚Äù Additional tables examine [phone rates in state prisons over time](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/phones/appendices2022_1.html) (supplemented by previous collection efforts), [state averages for local jails](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/phones/appendices2022_5.html), and more.

__State-authorized sports betting.__ [Legal¬†Sports¬†Report](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/), a gambling industry publication, has been tracking the [amount of money legally wagered on sports in each US state](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/sports-betting/revenue/), the amount kept by sportsbooks, and how much the government collected in taxes or revenue-sharing. Monthly figures, drawn from linked official sources, are available as HTML tables for more than two dozen states. The site also [tracks state legislation on sports betting](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/sportsbetting-bill-tracker/). __As seen in__: ‚Äú[How an Arizona Lobbying Frenzy Helped Sports App Bookies Write Their Own Rules](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-02/how-a-lobbying-frenzy-helped-sports-betting-apps-write-their-own-rules)‚Äù (Bloomberg).

__Drone registrations.__ Through a FOIA request to the Federal Aviation Administration, [Ben Welsh](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/) has [obtained data](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/database-of-14-cfr-part-48-registered-drones-132943/) on all ‚Äúsmall unmanned aircraft‚Äù (popularly known as drones) actively [registered](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/register_drone) with the agency through 2021 ‚Äî¬†nearly 900,000 registrations in all. The spreadsheets, provided separately for [commercial](https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/small-unmanned-aircraft-systems-uas-regulations-part-107) and [recreational](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_flyers) registrations, list each drone‚Äôs type and model, [Remote ID](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id/drone_pilots) capability, and registration date, plus the registrant‚Äôs city, state, and postcode. __Related__: Welsh, a journalist and [newly-licensed](https://www.reddit.com/r/drones/comments/xprv3n/comment/iq5ggqq/)  commercial drone pilot, has [filed many data FOIA requests](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/list/?user=7842&sort=date_submitted&order=desc), including [one](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/database-of-suas-drone-accident-reports-132824/) that pried loose the [FAA‚Äôs drone accident database](https://www.reddit.com/r/drones/comments/z1xtmq/faa_drone_accident_report_database_released_via/) (released, alas, as a PDF).

__Folklore motifs.__ [Decades ago](https://www.helsinki.fi/assets/drupal/2022-12/rmn_10_2015.pdf?page=58), anthropologist [Yuri Berezkin](https://www.kunstkamera.ru/en/research/academic_board/yuri_e_berezkin) began systematically assembling what would later become the [Electronic Analytical Catalogue of Folklore and Mythological Motifs](https://www.ruthenia.ru/folklore/berezkin/), which identifies thousands of recurring narrative elements and their presence within nearly 1,000 societies‚Äô stories. In a [paper published last year](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/136/4/1993/6124640), [Stelios Michalopoulos](https://sites.google.com/site/steliosecon/) and [Melanie Meng Xue](https://www.melaniexue.net/) describe the resource, [analyze it](https://broadstreet.blog/2021/05/14/folklore-a-window-into-the-past/), and [share a database snapshot from October 2019](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IXOHKB). 


__Ski trails.__ Contributors to [skimap.org](https://skimap.org/) have posted 16,000+ maps of ski trails [across the world](https://skimap.org/Regions/view). You can [programmatically access](https://skimap.org/pages/Developers) the (mostly image-based) maps as well as data on individual regions and ski areas. [OpenSkiMap](https://openskimap.org/), meanwhile, combines that information with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) records to provide an interactive map (and [structured data](https://openskimap.org/?about)) of ski areas, lifts, and runs.
