__Much mapping material.__ The [Overture Maps Foundation](https://overturemaps.org/) has [released](https://overturemaps.org/overture-maps-foundation-releases-first-world-wide-open-map-dataset/) its [first datasets](https://overturemaps.org/download/overture-july-alpha-release-notes/), which include 59 million ‚Äúpoints of interest‚Äù (landmarks, businesses, parks, etc.), 785 million building outlines, road network data, and administrative boundaries. The initiative, which is steered by several giant tech companies, ‚Äúcould help third-party developers use maps that don‚Äôt rely on Google and Apple,‚Äù [The Verge‚Äôs Emma Roth writes](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/26/23808274/meta-microsoft-amazon-overture-open-source-mapping). The [datasets](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data) draw on a range of sources, including the project‚Äôs member-companies, [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), and USGS‚Äôs [3D Elevation Program](https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program). __Read more__: ‚Äú[Exploring the Overture Maps places data using DuckDB, sqlite-utils and Datasette](https://til.simonwillison.net/overture-maps/overture-maps-parquet),‚Äù by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/), who considers the data release ‚Äúa really big deal.‚Äù [h/t [Avi Levin](https://twitter.com/Arithmomaniac)]


__Sweeteners.__ The US Department of Agriculture‚Äôs [Sugar and Sweeteners Yearbook Tables](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/sugar-and-sweeteners-yearbook-tables.aspx) provide ‚Äúsummary statistics on sugar, sugarbeets, sugarcane, corn sweeteners (dextrose, glucose, and high-fructose corn syrup), and honey.‚Äù Compiled by the agency‚Äôs [Economic Research Service](https://www.ers.usda.gov/) from a [range of national, international, and industry sources](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/sugar-and-sweeteners-yearbook-tables/documentation/), the statistics are provided as regularly-updated spreadsheets, many of which go back multiple decades. They estimate global and country-level production, supply, distribution, and prices, as well as US imports and consumption. [h/t [Sam Larson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shlarson/)]


__Federal Reserve communications.__ [Agam Shah et al.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4447632) have compiled a corpus of key communications by the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm), which ‚Äúcontrols the three tools of monetary policy ‚Äî open market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements.‚Äù Gathered from the Fed‚Äôs website, the corpus includes all meeting minutes and speeches from 1996 to mid-October 2022, and all press conferences from April 2011 to mid-October 2022. The [published records include](https://github.com/gtfintechlab/fomc-hawkish-dovish) the [raw text](https://github.com/gtfintechlab/fomc-hawkish-dovish/tree/main/data/raw_data) and [metadata](https://github.com/gtfintechlab/fomc-hawkish-dovish/tree/main/data/master_files) of each communication, as well as [datasets filtered to key sentences](https://github.com/gtfintechlab/fomc-hawkish-dovish/tree/main/data/filtered_data). __Previously__: [Federal Reserve Bank directors](https://www.brookings.edu/research/diversity-within-the-federal-reserve-system/) ([DIP 2021.05.05](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-05-05-edition/)) and [Fed forecasts](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/greenbook) ([DIP 2018.02.07](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-02-07-edition/)).


__English families.__ The [Families of England](http://neilcummins.com/foe.html) project, led by economic historians [Gregory Clark](https://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/) and [Neil Cummins](http://neilcummins.com/), aims ‚Äúto reconstruct the economic and social position, and the demography, of a representative set of English families‚Äù over time. A [recent paper by Clark](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300926120) includes a [public version of the dataset](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300926120#data-availability), which ‚Äúdetails the family connections of 422,374 people with rarer surnames in England for births from 1600 to 2022.‚Äù The dataset, based in part on genealogies from the [Guild of One-Name Studies](https://one-name.org/about-the-guild/), indicates (where available) each person‚Äôs years of birth, marriage, and death, plus indicators of literacy, sex, occupational status, and more.

__Winning numbers.__ New York State‚Äôs Gaming Commission [publishes various lottery-related datasets](https://data.ny.gov/browse?limitTo=datasets&tags=new+york+lottery&sortBy=most_accessed&utf8=%E2%9C%93), including the winning numbers for many national and state lotteries, such as [Powerball](https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/Lottery-Powerball-Winning-Numbers-Beginning-2010/d6yy-54nr) (since 2010), [Mega Millions](https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/Lottery-Mega-Millions-Winning-Numbers-Beginning-20/5xaw-6ayf) (since 2002), and [Pick 10](https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/Lottery-Pick-10-Winning-Numbers-Beginning-1987/bycu-cw7c) (since 1987). New York isn‚Äôt alone; the Colorado Lottery, for instance, [also publishes downloadable drawing histories](https://www.coloradolottery.com/en/player-tools/winning-history/). Their Powerball results go back to August 2001 and include the jackpot values, unavailable from New York. __As seen in__: ‚Äú[The jackpot is a lie](https://www.zachseward.com/the-jackpot-is-a-lie/),‚Äù by [Zach Seward](https://www.zachseward.com/).
