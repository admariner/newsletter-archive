Data Is Plural — 2020.03.25 edition
===================================

*More coronavirus data, but also transportation data from the US Census, a prisoner survey, and very old companies.*

&nbsp;

**COVID-19 cases, continued.** The [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/) has been publishing [a COVID-19 dashboard](https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/COVID-19.html) and [daily-updated data files](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) tracking country-level cases and deaths. **Related**: [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) [explains why the publication switched](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data) from using the [World Health Organization’s situation reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports) to the ECDC’s data for [its analyses and graphics](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). **Also related**: [USAFacts](https://usafacts.org/) is using data from state governments, local public health agencies, and Johns Hopkins University ([DIP 2020.03.11](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-03-11-edition)) to [map US cases at the county level](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/), with the underlying data available to download.

**Official coronavirus interventions.** [ACAPS](https://www.acaps.org/who-we-are/in-short), a humanitarian analysis nonprofit, is cataloguing [government measures implemented in response to the pandemic](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/acaps-covid19-government-measures-dataset). The measures range from quarantine policies (the most common) to electronic surveillance and the lockdown of refugee camps. As of Tuesday evening, the dataset contained 1,741 entries; each entry includes the date implemented, source links, and descriptive comments. Computational social scientist [Rex Douglass](https://rexdouglass.com/), meanwhile, is [crowdsourcing a dataset of mandatory government restrictions](https://github.com/rexdouglass/TIGR), such as bans on large gatherings, restaurant shutdowns, and shelter-in-place decrees. It has fewer entries so far, but [more detail on US cities and states](https://github.com/rexdouglass/TIGR/blob/master/data_out/TIGR_version1_latest.tsv).

**Getting around.** The [American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials](https://www.transportation.org/home/organization/)’ [Census Transportation Planning Products](https://ctpp.transportation.org/) initiative “produces special tabulations of American Community Survey (ACS) data that have enhanced value for transportation planning, analysis, and strategic direction,” such as commute times, carpooling, bicycle usage, available vehicles, and more. The program’s [core dataset](https://ctpp.transportation.org/2012-2016-5-year-ctpp/) “consists of almost 200 residence-based tables, 115 workplace-based tables and 39 flow tables (home to work) for over 325,000 geographies.” [h/t [Adrienne Heller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrienne-heller-aicp-env-sp-0b96837/)]

&nbsp;

**Prisoners, polled.** [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/) and [Slate](https://slate.com/) have partnered [to conduct](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/03/11/how-we-pulled-off-a-groundbreaking-political-survey-behind-bars) a [survey of incarcerated people’s political views](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/03/11/what-do-we-really-know-about-the-politics-of-people-behind-bars). They’ve received more than 8,000 responses so far, and have made the (anonymized) data [available to download](https://github.com/themarshallproject/incarcerated_survey).

&nbsp;

**Unfinished business.** [BusinessFinancing.co.uk](https://businessfinancing.co.uk/about/) attempted to identify [the oldest, still-operating companies in every country in the world](https://businessfinancing.co.uk/the-oldest-company-in-almost-every-country/), and put its findings into [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ynIAoLhz0SZYzjpwZ5e5mFzBxt6V28FTBjX7A99jq3E/edit#gid=1002274442).
