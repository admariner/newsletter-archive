Data Is Plural — 2015.11.18 edition
===================================

*The international flow of weapons, politicians on Instagram, exonerations in America, insecure health data, and British booze.*


__Follow the F-17s.__ The [Arms Transfer Database](http://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers/armstransfers) tracks the international flow of [major weapons](http://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers/armstransfers/background#Coverage) — artillery, missiles, military aircraft, tanks, and the like. Maintained by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the database contains documented sales since 1950 and is updated annually. SIPRI provides a [download tool](http://www.sipri.org/databases), which outputs rich-text files, but it’s also possible to [download the data as CSV](https://gist.github.com/jsvine/9cb3300588ed402160fe).

__\#campaign.__ The 2016 presidential hopefuls have been tweeting, ‘gramming, and ‘booking like a pack of millennials. Fusion [collected nearly 70,000 images](http://fusion.net/story/229021/2016-presidential-campaign-images/) from the candidates’ social media accounts, then pumped the pictures through an automated tagging system. Now you can search for [guns](http://fusion.net/interactive/213317/lose-yourself-in-our-massive-searchable-collection-of-candidates-social-media-photos/#tag=gun&order=date-desc), [money](http://fusion.net/interactive/213317/lose-yourself-in-our-massive-searchable-collection-of-candidates-social-media-photos/#tag=cash&order=date-desc), [beer](http://fusion.net/interactive/213317/lose-yourself-in-our-massive-searchable-collection-of-candidates-social-media-photos/#tag=beer&order=date-desc) [and more](http://fusion.net/interactive/213317/lose-yourself-in-our-massive-searchable-collection-of-candidates-social-media-photos/) — or download the raw data for your own analysis.


__America’s exonerees.__ The [National Registry of Exonerations](http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx) contains “every known exoneration in the United States since 1989—cases in which a person was wrongly convicted of a crime and later cleared of all the charges based on new evidence of innocence.” For each of the 1,702 cases, the [registry includes details](http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/detaillist.aspx) about the exoneree, the crime, and the factors — such as new DNA evidence — that contributed to the exoneration.

__Health data, unprotected.__ Under the HITECH Act of 2009, companies must notify the government of any data breach involving the [HIPAA-protected health data](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/summary/) of 500 or more people. Summaries of those reports are available at the [Department of Health and Human Services’s Breach Portal](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf), which currently contains more than 1,300 incidents. Related: In April, [JAMA published an analysis of the breaches](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2247135). Also related: [Forty years of legislative acronyms](http://noahveltman.com/acronyms/). [h/t [Virginia Hughes](https://twitter.com/virginiahughes)]


__Britain’s booze.__ What contains 34,052 bottles and is worth an estimated £3 million? The United Kingdom’s [official wine cellar](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-wine-cellar), which provides libations for the government’s guests and hosts — and [a dram of data for the public](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/annual-statement-on-the-government-wine-cellar-for-the-financial-year-2014-to-2015). Between April 2014 and March 2015, the cellar’s clients consumed more than 5,500 bottles of wine and liquor. Among them: 205 bottles of Champagne, 51-and-a-half bottles of gin, and one bottle Château Pichon-Longueville Comtesse de Lalande 1986. [h/t [Nadja Popovich](https://twitter.com/popovichn)]
