__Pesticide use.__ As part of its [National Water-Quality Assessment Project](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/national-water-quality-assessment-nawqa), the US Geological Survey publishes [maps and datasets](https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/) that [estimate local pesticide usage](https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/about.php), [based on](https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/0907/) ‚Äúproprietary surveys of farm operations.‚Äù The [datasets](https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/county-level/) provide high/low estimates (measured in kilograms) by county, chemical, and year, as well as [by crop group for each state](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/6081ae7cd34e8564d6866222). The most recent ‚Äúpreliminary‚Äù figures [refer to 2019](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/6081a924d34e8564d68661a1), with the next release not scheduled until ‚Äúlate 2024.‚Äù __Read more__: ‚Äú[Move to change how U.S. tracks pesticide use sparks protest](https://www.science.org/content/article/move-change-how-u-s-tracks-pesticide-use-sparks-protests),‚Äù an article by [Virginia Gewin](https://www.virginiagewin.com/) in *Science*, reporting on the pushback against USGS‚Äôs decision ‚Äúto reduce the number of chemicals it tracks and to release updates less frequently.‚Äù [h/t [Walt Hickey](https://www.numlock.com/p/numlock-news-june-1-2023-coconuts)]


__Commercial space launches.__ The Federal Aviation Administration [regulates the United States‚Äô commercial space transportation industry](https://www.faa.gov/space). The agency [publishes HTML tables](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/commercial_space_data/) listing [operator licenses](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/commercial_space_data/licenses/), [permits for experimental operations](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/commercial_space_data/launches/?type=Permitted), [licensed launches](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/commercial_space_data/launches/), and more. The 552 launches listed go back to 1989; each row indicates the date, payload, vehicle name, company, and site‚Äôs state (or ‚ÄúPacific Ocean‚Äù). __Related__: The FAA‚Äôs [map](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/images/ast/AST-Spaceport-Map_Sept2022.jpg) and [descriptions](https://www.faa.gov/space/spaceports_by_state) of the country‚Äôs [commercial spaceports](https://www.faa.gov/space/office_spaceports).

__Firearm suicide rates.__ A recent [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4453698) ([published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797\(23\)00205-2/fulltext)) and [dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QVYDUD) by [Megan Kang](https://www.megankang.com/) and [Elizabeth Rasich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-rasich-087b1a144/) ‚Äúextends an existing proxy for household gun ownership rates ‚Äî the rate of firearm suicide divided by suicide (FSS) ‚Äî from 1949 to 2020, including new coverage for the 1949 to 1972 period.‚Äù For each state and year, the dataset provides the count and population-adjusted rate of suicides, firearm suicides, homicides, and firearm homicides, among other figures. The first 30 years of firearm suicide/homicide counts had to be transcribed from scanned National Center for Health Statistics reports; later figures come from the CDC‚Äôs [WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/) and [WISQARS](https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html) systems.


__Harvard‚Äôs library holdings.__ [Harvard Library](https://library.harvard.edu/visit-about/about-harvard-library), ‚Äúthe oldest library system in the United States and the world‚Äôs largest academic library,‚Äù [provides several ways to access](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/harvard-library-apis-datasets) detailed metadata about its holdings, including its [LibraryCloud API](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/LibraryStaffDoc/LibraryCloud) and [bulk downloads](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/I8L0ZZ). The millions of items [described](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/Y5WUTU) include not only books, but also ‚Äújournals, scores, databases, sound recordings, films and video, images, maps,‚Äù and more.  __Previously__: [Metadata from the Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-068/) ([DIP 2017.05.24](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-05-24-edition/)).


__Ransomware negotiations.__  Negotiations between [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware) victims and their attackers ‚Äúare usually not shared widely, limiting the understanding of the process,‚Äù writes journalist [Val√©ry Marchive](https://github.com/Casualtek), whose [repository of chat transcripts](https://github.com/Casualtek/Ransomchats) ‚Äúaims at changing that, in a respectful manner for the victims of cyberattacks: chats are anonymized as long as the victim hasn‚Äôt been publicly disclosed, either by the attackers or in the media.‚Äù [h/t [Duncan Geere](https://www.duncangeere.com/)]
