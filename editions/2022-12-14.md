__Flu trends.__ The CDC‚Äôs Influenza Division collaborates with state and local health departments, hospitals, laboratories, and other partners to [keep tabs on flu trends](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm). Its [Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm) tracks case counts, positivity rates, strain distribution, and other metrics that you can [explore and download](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm) through an [interactive dashboard](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html). The records go back to the 1997‚Äì98 flu season and are available at a national, regional, and state level. __Read more__: ‚Äú[The US has never recorded this many positive flu tests in one week](https://www.vox.com/2022/12/6/23494948/flu-influenza-rsv-covid-vaccine-chart-tripledemic-tridemic)‚Äù (Vox).

__University enrollments.__ [Elizabeth Buckner](https://elizabethbuckner.com/)‚Äôs [Global Longitudinal University Enrollment Dataset](https://ejournals.bc.edu/index.php/ihe/article/view/15729) ‚Äúcompiles and estimates institution-level enrollment data on universities worldwide from 1950 to 2020‚Äù at five-year intervals ‚Äî 17,000+ institutions in all, across 180+ countries. In addition to enrollment figures, the [dataset](https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP3/P0D1KE&version=1.0) ‚Äúincludes a number of other useful variables on institutional characteristics, merged from various sources, including sector (i.e., public/private), founding year, and whether the institution is PhD granting or not.‚Äù It also forms the basis of an [accompanying, country-level dataset](https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP3/AJGTC9).


__Jewish texts.__ [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/), a [nonprofit co-founded a decade ago](https://www.sefaria.org/about) by author [Joshua Foer](https://joshuafoer.com/) and engineer [Brett Lockspeiser](https://brettlockspeiser.com/), is ‚Äúassembling a free living library of Jewish texts and their interconnections, in Hebrew and in translation.‚Äù Those texts [include](https://www.sefaria.org/texts) the Torah itself, plus rabbinic scholarship, legal works, prayer books, historical dictionaries, and more. In all, the project [contains](https://www.sefaria.org/metrics) more than 300 million words and has generated 3 million intertextual links between them. The initiative provides its data via [an API](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/wiki/API-Documentation) and [bulk download](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Export), and its code is [open-source](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project). __Read more__: ‚Äú[The quest to put the Talmud online](https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2018/09/18/quest-put-talmud-online/)‚Äù (Washington Post, 2018).

__Women‚Äôs college basketball rosters.__ Students in [Derek Willis](https://merrill.umd.edu/directory/derek-willis)‚Äôs ‚Äú[Sports Data Analysis & Visualization](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/202208/JOUR/JOUR479X)‚Äù course at the University of Maryland‚Äôs journalism school have [assembled](https://twitter.com/derekwillis/status/1600946516272861185) data on [13,000+ players on women‚Äôs college basketball teams](https://github.com/Sports-Roster-Data/womens-college-basketball), sourced from 900+ rosters for the 2022‚Äì23 NCAA season. Their main dataset lists each player‚Äôs name, team, position, jersey number, height, year, hometown, high school, and more.


__Mastodon membership.__ The [open-source](https://github.com/TheKinrar/instances) website [instances.social](https://instances.social/) tracks 16,000+ servers running [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), the most prominent of the decentralized social networks seen as alternatives to Twitter. It collects each server‚Äôs domain, name, description, user count, status count, and more. Since late November, [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) has been [creating a longitudinal record of the site‚Äôs directory](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/20/tracking-mastodon/) and [charting the overall trend](https://observablehq.com/@simonw/mastodon-users-and-statuses-over-time).
