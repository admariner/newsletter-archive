Data Is Plural — 2020.11.11 edition
===================================

*Child detention, USPS performance, transit costs, the early Islamic world, and the opera.*


__Child detention.__ The Marshall Project has [obtained and published](https://github.com/themarshallproject/cbp-migrantchildren-detention-data) official data from US Customs and Border Protection listing 580,000+ times that the agency detained migrant children since early 2017. For each detention, the dataset [includes](https://observablehq.com/@themarshallproject/cbp-child-detentions-2017-to-2020) the date and time the child entered and left CBP custody, as well as the child’s age, gender, and citizenship. __Related__: [The Marshall Project’s report on the data](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/10/30/500-000-kids-30-million-hours-trump-s-vast-expansion-of-child-detention).


__USPS performance.__ As part of [*Jones v. United States Postal Service*](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17449832/jones-v-united-states-postal-service/), a federal lawsuit filed in August, USPS must submit weekly performance reports that indicate, at a national and district level, the percentage of mail that was processed (though not necessarily delivered) on time. The agency files these reports as PDFs; [Save the Post Office](https://www.savethepostoffice.com/), a [decade-old website run by a retired English professor](https://www.savethepostoffice.com/about/), has been [collecting those PDFs](https://www.savethepostoffice.com/updates-on-the-service-performance-reports/) and converting them [into spreadsheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WIiUIu0PP_5D1j8R_-T7IN7kVWk9lvuj). __Related__: [Aaron Gordon’s pre-election analysis of the USPS data](https://themail.substack.com/p/crunch-time), from [Gordon’s (limited-run) newsletter about the postal service](https://themail.substack.com/).


__Transit costs.__ “Why do transit-infrastructure projects in New York cost 20 times more on a per kilometer basis than in Seoul?” With the aim of answering questions like these, the NYU-based [Transit Costs Project](https://transitcosts.com/about/) is building [a dataset](https://transitcosts.com/data/) that already spans [more than 500 urban rail projects](https://transitcosts.com/projects/) around the world. For each project, the dataset specifies the city, start year, end year, rail length, number of stations, total cost, and more.


__The early Islamic world.__ The [al-Ṯurayyā Project](https://althurayya.github.io/) features an interactive map of the early Islamic world, with 2,000 named locations — from Damascus to Baghdad and beyond — and historical routes between them. The [underlying dataset](https://github.com/althurayya/althurayya.github.io/tree/master/master) includes geocoordinates, Arabic spellings, transliterations, primary sources, and other details.

__The opera.__ [Operabase](https://www.operabase.com/) has gathered information about more than 500,000 opera performances staged since 1996. The website doesn’t provide direct downloads but you can access [a dataset on six full seasons of stagings](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/8LUFN8), covering thousands of runs in hundreds of cities, thanks to a “data donation” to support [Alexander N. Cuntz](https://ideas.repec.org/e/pcu83.html)’s [study of how copyright affects performance frequency](https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4521).
