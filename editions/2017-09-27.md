Data Is Plural — 2017.09.27 edition
===================================

*Crime data, chyrons, every building in Great Britain, NYC street quality/closures, and job skills.*


__Easier-to-use crime data.__ Earlier this month, [the FBI and 18F released](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/09/07/opening-the-nations-crime-data/) the first iteration of their [Crime Data Explorer](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/), a website that simplifies access to the FBI’s [Uniform Crime Reporting program](https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-program-data-collections). You can [download bulk data](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/downloads-and-docs) on individual incidents, state and national trends, hate crimes, arrests, assaults on officers, police employees, human trafficking, and cargo theft. You can also [access the data via an API](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/api). __Caution:__ The FBI’s data collection program is voluntary; [not all law enforcement agencies participate](https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs/2015/tables/data-tables). (In fact, [more than 3,000 agencies don’t submit hate crime data](https://www.propublica.org/article/hate-crimes-are-up-but-the-government-isnt-keeping-good-track-of-them).)

__Chyrons.__ The TV News Archive’s new [“Third Eye” project](http://blog.archive.org/2017/09/21/tv-news-chyron-data/) is extracting chyrons — those placards of text at the bottom of news broadcasts, also known as “lower thirds” — from four major cable networks: BBC News, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. The [resulting database](https://archive.org/services/third-eye.php) contains every chyron that Third Eye’s optical character recognition (OCR) software has extracted since late August. __Related:__ [This Washington Post piece analyzing cable news’ chyrons during James Comey’s congressional testimony](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/comey-hearing-chyrons/), and [this explanation of how they did it](https://source.opennews.org/articles/how-we-tracked-cable-news-chyrons/).

__Every building, river, and green space in Great Britain.__ The UK’s Ordnance Survey makes [detailed digital maps of Great Britain](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/opendata-products.html). Their free offerings include all of the island’s [roads](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-roads.html), [rivers](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-rivers.html), [green spaces](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-greenspace.html), and [place names](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-names.html). The Survey’s [“open map”](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-map-local.html) includes buildings, railways, electricity transmission lines, and other features. __Related:__ Want only the buildings? [The University of Sheffield’s Alasdair Rae has you covered](http://www.statsmapsnpix.com/2017/09/buildings-of-great-britain.html).

__NYC streets: the good, the bad, and the closed.__ New York City’s Department of Transportation [publishes a bunch of data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml), including [its own assessments of each street segment’s quality](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Street-Pavement-Rating/2cav-chmn) on a 1-to-10 scale. It also publishes spreadsheets of all construction-related street closures, [by intersection](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Street-Closures-due-to-construction-activities-by-/478a-yykk) and [by block](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Street-Closures-due-to-construction-activities-by-/i6b5-j7bu), updated daily.

__Your job, in numbers.__ For each of 966 occupations, the Department of Labor’s [O\*NET database](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html?p=3) quantifies the types knowledge, skills, abilities, education, and training required, tasks involved, tools used, and more job-related parameters. __Related:__ The Upshot uses the data to ask (and answer), “[What Is Your Opposite Job?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/08/upshot/what-is-your-opposite-job.html)”
