Data Is Plural — 2025.02.26 edition
===================================

*Presidential schedules, water availability, 18 million deceased veterans, Argentine treaties, and chord progressions.*


__Presidential schedules.__ Among its various White House–related undertakings, [Roll Call Factba.se](https://rollcall.com/factbase/) provides  event-by-event structured data representing the public presidential calendars for [Donald Trump](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/calendar/) and [Joe Biden](https://rollcall.com/factbase/biden/calendar/) since the latter’s inauguration in January 2021. The schedules, available to download in bulk, provide each event’s day and time, location, a brief description, and other details. They contain 9,400+ entries from Biden’s four years in office plus another 300+ from Trump’s second term so far. The events include those from the official presidential schedule, those derived from [pool reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_pool), and press briefings. __As seen in__: [POTUS Tracker](https://potustracker.us/faq).

__Water availability.__ The US Geological Survey last month [released](https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/usgs-releases-a-comprehensive-look-water-resources-united-states) its [National Water Availability Assessment](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/integrated-water-availability-assessments/national-water-availability-assessments), “a pioneering scientific overview of water availability that offers first-of-its-kind insights into the balance between water supply and demand across the conterminous United States.” Alongside the [report](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/us-geological-survey-integrated-water-availability-assessment-2010-20), USGS launched a “[data companion](https://water.usgs.gov/nwaa-data/)” [providing](https://water.usgs.gov/nwaa-data/data-overview) “regularly updated, model-based estimates” of monthly water usage within each of the country’s [hydrologic units](https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html). Estimates for water availability and water supply are “coming soon,” while those for water quality and aquatic ecosystems are “coming later.”


__18 million deceased veterans.__ [BIRLS.org](https://www.birls.org/), a new website from [Reclaim The Records](https://www.reclaimtherecords.org/), provides “an index to basic biographical information on more than 18 million deceased American veterans who received some sort of veterans benefits in their lifetime”. Those [records](https://archive.org/details/BIRLS_database), [obtained through a FOIA lawsuit](https://www.reclaimtherecords.org/records-request/20/), represent a substantial chunk of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem. The site also helps you file follow-up requests for any individual’s “full VA claims file, which may contain hundreds of pages of never-before-seen biographical and historical material about the veteran, their military service, and their interactions with the VA.” __Note__: The “database is *not* a comprehensive database of all American veterans, but rather a partial and incomplete index of veterans who were eligible for VA benefits or whose heirs had some kind of contact with the VA regarding benefits.”


__Argentine treaties.__ [Javier I. Santander](https://jisantander.com/), a career diplomat, has built a [dataset of 8,200+ bilateral treaties signed by Argentina from 1810 and 2023](https://jisantander.com/ressources/bilaterals/). It lists each treaty’s title, status, date signed, and counterpart country. The dataset is based on the government’s [Digital Library of Treaties](https://tratados.cancilleria.gob.ar/), where you can find copies of the treaties themselves. The most common counterparts have been neighboring countries — Chile, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay — followed by Germany, the US, and Italy.


__Chord progressions.__ [Spyridon Kantarelis et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22046v1) have created [CHORDONOMICON](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ailsntua/Chordonomicon), a dataset identifying the progressions of 51 million chords in 667,000+ songs. The dataset is based on [tablatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablature) from the website [Ultimate Guitar](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) and then “annotated with structural parts, genre, and release date”. Most entries also include the [song’s and artist’s IDs in Spotify’s system](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/spotify-uris-ids). [h/t Dale Debber]
