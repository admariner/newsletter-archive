Data Is Plural — 2015.11.11 edition
===================================

*In this week’s newsletter: Naughty companies, side effects that may include nausea, Albuquerque’s open-data initiative, lots of books, and a tiny dataset with an outsized legacy.*


__Naughty companies.__ Good Jobs First’s [Violation Tracker](http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/violation-tracker) calls itself “the first national search engine on corporate misconduct.” The new database [currently contains](http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/violation-tracker-data-sources) nearly 100,000 penalties for environmental, health, and safety violations — sourced from 13 U.S. regulatory agencies — since 2010. Search results can be downloaded as CSV files, which contain a few additional fields. (Tip: Search for “\*” to get all cases.) The largest single fine? The Department of Justice’s [$20.8 billion penalty this year against BP](http://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/bp).

__The 139,756 side effects of 1,430 medical drugs.__ The [Side Effect Resource](http://sideeffects.embl.de/), a.k.a. SIDER, takes all the fine print from drug labels, and aggregates the information about side effects into a searchable, downloadable database. SIDER got a [major upgrade last month](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/10/19/nar.gkv1075.abstract), and now contains 40% more drug-effect pairs than before. The website incorporates both generic and brand names, so that searches for “Prozac” and “fluoxetine” bring you to [the same page](http://sideeffects.embl.de/drugs/3386/).


__Albuquerque’s impressive open-data program.__ The New Mexico city publishes [dozens of regularly-updated, well-documented datasets](http://www.cabq.gov/abq-data). Among them: government employee earnings, the number of daily visitors to the city’s swimming pools, real-time bus locations, the geography of police beats, and the city’s complete vendor checkbook. [h/t [Tom Johnson](http://online.sfsu.edu/jjohnson/), who emailed Data Is Plural to praise how Albuquerque is sharing its data: “I have not found any other city in the world doing so in such detail.”]


__1.8 billion pages of books (and booklike things).__ Earlier this year, the HathiTrust Research Center [released](https://www.hathitrust.org/htrc-releases-massive-dataset) a [massive dataset](https://portal.htrc.illinois.edu/features) extracted from 4.8 million digitized volumes. For each of its 1.8 billion pages, the dataset includes word frequencies, languages used, and sentence counts, among other features.


__Deadly Prussian horses.__ For his 1898 book, *The Law of Small Numbers*, statistician [Ladislaus Bortkiewicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladislaus_Bortkiewicz) tabulated the [number of Prussian cavalrymen killed by horse kicks](http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/HorseKicks.html) each year between 1875 and 1894. (In total, 196 suffered that tragic fate.) The dataset is tiny, but boasts an outsized legacy: Bortkiewicz’s lethal horse kicks allegedly helped to [popularize the then-obscure Poisson distribution](http://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2013/06/21/what-do-deaths-from-horse-kicks-have-to-do-with-statistics/).

*And a correction from last week’s item on the [ATF’s firearm licensee database](https://data.atf.gov/Licensees/Federal-Firearms-Licensee-Listing-2010-to-2015/qg4c-kex6): There are only nine categories of license-holders, not eleven. Additionally, the database includes only eight of those nine categories; it does not include "Collector of Curios and Relics." Data Is Plural regrets the error.
