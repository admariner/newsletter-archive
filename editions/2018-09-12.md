Data Is Plural — 2018.09.12 edition
===================================

*Power outages, deaths in Puerto Rico, parking tickets in Chicago, neighborhood boundaries, and breweries.*


__Power outages.__ Utility companies are [required to report](https://www.oe.netl.doe.gov/oe417.aspx) major power outages and other “electric disturbance events” to the Department of Energy within a business day (or, depending on the type of event, sooner) of the incident. The federal agency then aggregates the reports [annual summary datasets](https://www.oe.netl.doe.gov/OE417_annual_summary.aspx). For each event, the data includes the time it began and was resolved, the geographic areas it affected, the type of incident, and the estimated number of customers affected.

__Deaths in Puerto Rico.__ Last month, Puerto Rico’s government began publishing a dataset of [all deaths registered in the U.S. territory](https://datos.estadisticas.pr/dataset/defunciones) from January 2017, updated weekly. For each death, the information includes the year and month of the death; the type and causes of death; the deceased’s age, sex, marital status, occupation, place of birth and residence, and more. __Related:__ “[More Than 2,000 Puerto Ricans Applied For Funeral Assistance After Hurricane Maria.

__Parking tickets in Chicago.__ “For the first time, the city’s database, which tracks more than 28 million parking and vehicle compliance tickets, is easily available to the public,” [according to ProPublica Illinois](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/download-chicago-parking-ticket-data), which has [published the two-gigabyte dataset](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/chicago-parking-ticket-data) in collaboration with WBEZ. The dataset, which covers January 2007 to mid-May 2018, “includes information on when, where, and by whom tickets were issued; de-identified license plates; vehicle make; registration zip code; the violation for which the vehicle was cited; the payment status and more.”


__Neighborhood boundaries.__ Zillow has created a dataset outlining the [boundaries of more than 17,000 neighborhoods](https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/neighborhood-boundaries.htm) in the United States’ largest cities, spanning 49 states (all but Wyoming) plus D.C. and Puerto Rico. __Related:__ OpenStreetMap, which is [API-queryable](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Databases_and_data_access_APIs), has a [“neighbourhood” tag type](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:place%3Dneighbourhood).

__Breweries.__ [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) is a searchable database of more than 8,000 breweries in the United States (although “future plans are to import world-wide data”). The site provides an API, which lets you query by name, location, and type — microbrewery, regional brewery, brewpub, and so on. __Previously:__ [Official brewery statistics](https://www.ttb.gov/beer/beer-stats.shtml) (DIP [2017.05.24](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-05-24-edition)).
