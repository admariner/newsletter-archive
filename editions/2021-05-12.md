*Hate groups, law schools, TSA screenings, European cross-border rail, and e.e. cummings.*


__Hate groups.__ For decades, the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/) has conducted annual censuses of US-based hate groups, [which it defines](https://www.splcenter.org/20200318/frequently-asked-questions-about-hate-groups) as those with “beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.” [Its 2020 review](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2021/02/01/year-hate-and-extremism-2020-hate-groups-became-more-difficult-track-amid-covid-and) found 838 such groups — a decline from prior years, which the researchers attribute to several factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of difficult-to-track online networks, and “the continuing collapse of the Ku Klux Klan.” The center’s [map of 2000–2020 findings](https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map) links to annual spreadsheets that detail each group’s title, location, and ideology.


__Law schools.__ [To receive accreditation](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/accreditation/) from the American Bar Association, law schools must submit a range of data-points about tuition, financial aid, student demographics, class sizes, employment outcomes, and more. The ABA’s [disclosure site](http://www.abarequireddisclosures.org/Disclosure509.aspx) provides school-level PDF reports, as well as annual spreadsheets comparing all accredited schools since 2011. __Related__: “[There Are Only Two Black Male Prosecutors For All Of Long Island](https://gothamist.com/news/there-are-only-two-black-male-prosecutors-all-long-island),” a recent Gothamist article  that uses the data.

__TSA screenings.__ In [its FOIA reading room](https://www.tsa.gov/foia/readingroom), the US Transportation Security Administration publishes weekly PDF files that indicate the number of people passing through its checkpoints, broken down by hour and location. IT specialist [Mike Lorengo](https://github.com/mikelor) has been [converting](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/mx87q8/tsa_throughput_dataset_alternate_source/) these PDFs [into structured data files](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput). __Related__: The TSA also publishes a [table of total “traveler throughput”](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput) for each day in 2021, compared to the same weekdays in 2020 and 2019. 


__European cross-border rail.__ Drawing from company websites and communications with government railway agencies, [OBC Transeuropa](https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/About-us)’s [Gianluca De Feo](https://twitter.com/GianlucaDeFeo) and [Lorenzo Ferrari](https://twitter.com/lorferr) have [identified 271 passenger train routes](https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/More-and-more-trains-crossing-European-borders) that cross Europe’s national borders. For each route, [their dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12deGLMuX3u-mUaHGlLT0-TXIGZnQ-NILCt6NRA4s0pU/edit) lists its two endpoints, the countries it passes through, route type (high-speed, regional, etc.), operating company, and more. __Related__: “[Four ways of looking at European cross-border rail links](https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Europe/Four-ways-of-looking-at-European-cross-border-rail-links-209800),” a follow-up article.

__Edward Estlin Cummings.__ The [e.e. cummings free poetry archive](https://cummings.ee/), [launched last week](https://palewi.re/posts/2021/05/02/ee-cummings-archive/) by journalist [Ben Welsh](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/), “aims to republish all of the author’s work as it gradually enters the public domain.” So far, it includes more than 100 poems, available to read online and [as data files](https://cummings.ee/downloads/) that include each poem’s collection, title, first line, and full text. __Read more__: [Welsh’s introductory Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/palewire/status/1389214308400173064), which highlights technical details and volunteer contributions.
