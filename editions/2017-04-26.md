Data Is Plural — 2017.04.26 edition
===================================

*National park visitors, word frequencies, women’s empowerment, family growth, and collaborative art.*


__National park visitors.__ The U.S. National Park Service publishes a [ton of data about visitors](https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/National) to its parks, historic sites, memorials, preserves, and more. Among them: Visitors per park (annually since 1904, and monthly since 1979), overnight stays by type of lodging (tents, RVs, backcountry, etc.), and traffic. __Related:__ “[The National Parks Have Never Been More Popular](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-national-parks-have-never-been-more-popular/)” (FiveThirtyEight, 2016).

__Word frequencies.__ You’re probably familiar with the [Google Books Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=data+is%2Cdata+are&year_start=1800&year_end=2012&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cdata%20is%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cdata%20are%3B%2Cc0), which lets you chart word and phrase frequencies over time. Google publishes the [underlying data](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html) but those files can (depending on your tools and goals) be cumbersomely large. Here’s an alternative: DIP reader (and former colleague) Chris Wilson [has condensed](http://mechanicalscribe.com/notes/google-ngrams-for-cmu-pronunciation-dictionary/) the overall frequencies for 87,000 words — those found in the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict) — into [a svelte, four-megabyte file](https://github.com/mechanicalscribe/cmu_tf_idf). __Related:__ [BYU’s advanced interface to the Google Books data](http://googlebooks.byu.edu/x.asp). __Also related:__ “[The Pitfalls of Using Google Ngram to Study Language](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/pitfalls-of-studying-language-with-google-ngram/)” (Wired, 2015). __And also:__ “[Somewhere at Google there is a database containing 25 million books and nobody is allowed to read them](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/the-tragedy-of-google-books/523320/)” (The Atlantic, 2017).


__Women’s empowerment in India.__ For each of India’s 36 states and Union Territories, the country’s [latest National Family Health Survey](http://rchiips.org/nfhs/factsheet_NFHS-4.shtml) includes 114 metrics, such as the percentages of “households using iodized salt” and “men who have comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS.” Unfortunately, the government publishes the reports only as PDFs. But the Hindustan Times has [extracted the data](https://github.com/HindustanTimesLabs/women-empowerment-index) for the survey’s eight “women’s empowerment and gender based violence” metrics, including the percentages of “ever-married women who have ever experienced spousal violence” and “women having a bank or savings account that they themselves use.” They’ve published that data [as a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/179onU4jvFPqhLlM-7ZJu5xv0LQLOsQq-TrMJNFQkSjI/edit#gid=1937549234) and used it to construct an [interactive Women Empowerment Index](http://www.hindustantimes.com/interactives/women-empowerment-index/).

__Marriage and divorce, pregnancy and infertility in the U.S.__ The CDC has been running its [National Survey of Family Growth](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm) since 1973. For the first three decades, it surveyed only women ages 15-44. Starting in 2002, it began also surveying men. The [latest survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2013_2015_puf.htm) was conducted in 2013-15, when it collected data from 10,205 residents about sexual activity and contraception, pregnancy and infertility, marriage and divorce, adoption, parenting, and more.

__This must be the r/place.__ For April Fools, Reddit launched a [million-pixel canvas](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) called “r/place.” Users could place a single-pixel tile, in one of 16 colors, anywhere on the canvas — but only every five minutes. By the end of r/place’s 72-hour lifetime, Redditors had placed 16.5 million tiles on the canvas, likely making it “the largest collaborative art project in history.” Last week, Reddit published the [entire history of the canvas](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdata/comments/6640ru/place_datasets_april_fools_2017/) as structured data.
