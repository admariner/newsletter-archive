*The 🇺🇸 🇲🇽  border fence, auto insurance, grocery orders, science doctorates, and sarcasm.*


__The border fence.__ There’s about 700 miles of official fencing between the U.S. and Mexico, covering about one-third of the full border. The Department of Homeland Security doesn’t provide structured spatial data about the fence’s path. But, thanks to [a Texas law professor’s FOIA](https://law.utexas.edu/humanrights/borderwall/maps/background-maps.html) and [some serious elbow grease](http://cironline.org/blog/post/surprising-tools-cir-used-map-us-mexico-border-fence-6255), reporters at Reveal [have created](https://www.revealnews.org/article/the-wall-building-a-continuous-u-s-mexico-barrier-would-be-a-tall-order/) “the most detailed border fence map publicly available.” For each segment of fence, [Reveal’s dataset](https://github.com/cirlabs/border_fence_map) includes the fence type (i.e., pedestrian, vehicle, or unknown), the government’s name for the segment, and the project through which the segment was built.


__Insurance premiums and payouts.__ Last month, ProPublica and Consumer Reports published an [analysis of car insurance costs in four states](https://www.propublica.org/article/minority-neighborhoods-higher-car-insurance-premiums-white-areas-same-risk), finding that “some major insurers charge minority neighborhoods as much as 30 percent more than other areas with similar accident costs.” The reporters also published a [detailed methodology](https://www.propublica.org/article/minority-neighborhoods-higher-car-insurance-premiums-methodology) and [dataset](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/carinsurance#src-line) supporting their findings. The dataset contains company-by-company insurance premiums for a (hypothetical) college-educated, excellent-credit, accident-free 30-year-old woman in each of 6,261 ZIP codes in the four states — California, Texas, Missouri, and Illinois. The dataset also includes several years of average (per-car) insurance payouts for each ZIP code, which the reporters obtained from state insurance commissioners. __Related:__ The [insurance industry's rebuttal](http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2017/04/05/447012.htm) and [ProPublica's counter-rebuttal](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-car-insurance-industry-attacks-our-story-our-response).


__Three million grocery orders.__ Groceries-on-demand startup Instacart has released a [dataset containing 3 million orders from 200,000 (anonymized) users](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017). “For each user, we provide between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order,” [the company’s head of data science writes](https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2). “We also provide the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.” [Here’s the data dictionary](https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b).


__What do you do with a PhD in science?__ The National Science Foundation’s [Survey of Doctorate Recipients](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctoratework/) “is a longitudinal biennial survey conducted since 1973 that provides demographic and career history information about individuals with a research doctoral degree in a science, engineering, or health (SEH) field from a U.S. academic institution.” You can download [aggregated data](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctoratework/#tabs-2) and [detailed survey responses](https://sestat.nsf.gov/datadownload/) going back to 1993. The next release is [scheduled for this month](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/next-releases.cfm#survey5). __Related:__ The NSF has published [an interactive graphic of the data](https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/sei/infographic2/).

__\*Such\* an important dataset.__ Grad students in Princeton’s computer science department have published [a dataset they call Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus](http://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/SARC/), or “SARC” for short. “The corpus has 1.3 million sarcastic statements — 10 times more than any previous dataset,” [the authors write](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05579), and takes advantage of Reddit users’ habit of tagging sarcastic comments with an “/s”. __Related:__ [A dataset of sarcastic Amazon reviews](https://github.com/ef2020/SarcasmAmazonReviewsCorpus/wiki).
