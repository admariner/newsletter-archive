*An official Congress API, voter ID laws, local internet speeds, the Getty Provenance Index, and space weather.*

*üëã Welcome to the 300th(!) edition of Data Is Plural. To mark the occasion, I‚Äôve published a [bonus, self-referential, ultra-niche dataset of the newsletter‚Äôs feedback-soliciting phrases](https://github.com/data-is-plural/feedback-phrases).*


__Congress gets an official API.__ The United States‚Äô legislative branch now has [an official API](https://api.congress.gov/), [the Library of Congress announced last week](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2022/09/introducing-the-congress-gov-api/). It [provides](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/) structured data on legislators, bills, bill summaries, amendments, committee reports, appointee nominations, international treaties, and more. To use the service, you‚Äôll need to [sign up for a free API key](https://api.congress.gov/sign-up/). __Read more__: [Some context from the Congressional Data Coalition](https://congressionaldata.org/library-of-congress-launches-congress-gov-api/). __Related__: The Government Publishing Office‚Äôs [bulk data on bills and bill summaries](https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata) ([DIP 2020.08.26](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-08-26-edition/)) and [ProPublica‚Äôs Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/).

__Voter ID laws.__ As part of his PhD research, [Tom Barton](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/thomas-barton\(8a862a25-f335-4c52-9986-6c094b613b55\).html) has [constructed](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00344893.2022.2113117) a [dataset of voter identification requirements around the world](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/RU2F9A). For each country and US state, the dataset indicates the type of identification needed to vote (a photo ID, non-photo ID, or just basic personal details), how many forms of identification the voter must provide, and more. __Related__: [A detailed examination of US voter ID laws](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx) from the National Conference of State Legislatures. __Previously__: [Recent US voting legislation](https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/pending/search) tracked by the [Voting Rights Lab](https://votingrightslab.org/) ([DIP 2022.07.20](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-07-20-edition/)).


__Local internet speeds.__ If you‚Äôve tried measuring your internet speed, you might have used [Ookla](https://www.ookla.com/)‚Äôs [testing service](https://www.speedtest.net/). The company [releases](https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good/open-data) a series of [quarterly datasets that summarize the test results](https://github.com/teamookla/ookla-open-data), aggregated into geospatial tiles. (The tile sizes vary by latitude but measure roughly 2,000 feet by 2,000 feet at the equator.) For each tile, the datasets list the number of tests performed and devices tested, plus the average download speed, upload speed, and latency. __As seen in__: ‚Äú[Europe‚Äôs internet speeds are faster than ever, but not for everyone](https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Europe-s-internet-speeds-are-faster-than-ever-but-not-for-everyone)‚Äù (EDJNet) and [associated dashboard](https://datavis.europeandatajournalism.eu/obct/connectivity/). __Previously__: [Internet speeds from the Measurement Lab](https://www.measurementlab.net/data/) ([DIP 2019.05.22](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-05-22-edition/)).

__Art sales and ownership.__ The [Getty Provenance Index](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/) contains more than 2.3 million [historical records](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/charts.html) relating to the sale and ownership of artworks, [searchable online](https://piprod.getty.edu/starweb/pi/servlet.starweb?path=pi/pi.web) by artist, owner, auction house, date, and other characteristics. As part of an [ongoing project to remodel the index](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/provenance_remodel/index.html), the [Getty Research Institute](https://www.getty.edu/research/) has also published a subset of the records as [open data](https://github.com/thegetty/provenance-index-csv). The [largest of those datasets](https://github.com/thegetty/provenance-index-csv/tree/main/sales_catalogs) describes more than 1 million sales in eight European countries, with dates ranging from the 1600s to 1945.

__Space weather.__ NOAA‚Äôs [Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.spaceweather.gov/) keeps tabs on a [variety of phenomena](https://www.spaceweather.gov/phenomena), such as [coronal mass ejections](https://www.spaceweather.gov/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections), [geomagnetic storms](https://www.spaceweather.gov/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms), and [solar flares](https://www.spaceweather.gov/phenomena/solar-flares-radio-blackouts). The agency‚Äôs [reports and datasets](https://www.spaceweather.gov/products-and-data) include [three-day forecasts](https://www.spaceweather.gov/products/3-day-forecast), [sunspot predictions](https://www.spaceweather.gov/products/predicted-sunspot-number-and-radio-flux), [solar wind observations](https://www.spaceweather.gov/products/real-time-solar-wind), and [more](https://www.spaceweather.gov/content/data-access). The agency also provides [dashboards for several audiences](https://www.spaceweather.gov/dashboards), such as the [aviation community](https://www.spaceweather.gov/communities/aviation-community-dashboard), [emergency management](https://www.spaceweather.gov/communities/emergency-management), and ‚Äú[space weather enthusiasts](https://www.spaceweather.gov/communities/space-weather-enthusiasts-dashboard).‚Äù [h/t [oblib](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32707051)]
