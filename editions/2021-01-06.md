*Megascale coronavirus surveys, commodity-transportation costs, more college sports financing, ten million Jupyter notebooks, and 2020 in haiku.*

&nbsp;

**Megascale coronavirus surveys.** Carnegie Mellon University’s [epidemiological forecasting group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/about/) and Facebook have partnered to field a [large-scale coronavirus survey in the US](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/surveys/); they’ve collected [more than 15 million responses since April 2020](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/). The University of Maryland has [formed a similar partnership](https://covidmap.umd.edu/) for an international survey, in which “a representative sample of Facebook users is invited on a daily basis to report on symptoms, social distancing behavior, mental health issues, and financial constraints”; [millions have also participated](https://ischool.umd.edu/news/university-maryland-carnegie-mellon-and-facebook-team-forecast-coronavirus-spread). Geographically-aggregated results of the US survey can be downloaded via an [online interface](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/export/) or [Delphi’s API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html); the international results are also [available via API](https://covidmap.umd.edu/api.html). **Practical example**: [An analysis of state-by-state mask usage, with code](https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2020/12/13/are-masks-widely-used-in-public/).

**Commodity-transportation costs.** The UN and the World Bank have [launched](https://unctad.org/news/why-and-how-measure-international-transport-costs) a new [interactive map](https://unctadstat.unctad.org/EN/TransportCost.html) and [dataset](https://unctadstat.unctad.org/wds/ReportFolders/reportFolders.aspx?IF_ActivePath=P%2C207045) that quantify the transportation costs for international trade — country-by-country and broken down by mode of transportation (sea, air, rail, road), trading partner, and commodity. The numbers, based both on directly-reported figures and statistical modelling, include costs overall, per unit, and per unit per kilometer. The project currently covers only 2016, but has plans to expand. [h/t [Jan Hoffmann](https://twitter.com/JanHoffmann_gva/status/1341414753567186947)]

**More college sports financing.** The [College Athletics Financial Information Database](http://cafidatabase.knightcommission.org), run by the privately-funded [Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics](https://www.knightcommission.org), details the annual sources of revenue (such as ticket sales) and expenses (such as coaches’ compensation) for hundreds of schools, based on information self-reported to the NCAA and federal government. Many of the records [were obtained](http://cafidatabase.knightcommission.org/about-the-data) via freedom-of-information requests by [USA Today and Syracuse University students](https://sports.usatoday.com/2020/07/05/methodology-for-2019-ncaa-athletic-department-revenue-database/). [h/t [Craig Garthwaite et al.](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/our-work/working-papers/2020/wp-20-42.html)]

**Millions of computational notebooks.** In 2017, a team of researchers [downloaded and analyzed](https://github.com/activityhistory/jupyter_on_github) 1.25 million publicly-available Jupyter notebooks — [documents](https://jupyter.org/) that weave computational code, output, and text. They also [published](https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb6931851t) the notebooks and their related metadata. Inspired by that project, a team at JetBrains recently did a follow-up scan, [analyzing and publishing data on nearly 10 million notebooks](https://blog.jetbrains.com/datalore/2020/12/17/we-downloaded-10-000-000-jupyter-notebooks-from-github-this-is-what-we-learned/).

&nbsp;

**2020 in haiku.** Over the course of 2020, [Eli Holder](https://twitter.com/elibryan) paid workers on Mechanical Turk to turn news headlines into 5/7/5-syllable poems. The result: 2,760 “Doom Haikus,” which you can [browse on a timeline](https://doomhaikus.3iap.co/) or [download in bulk](https://www.kaggle.com/newshaikus/dataset). For each poem, the dataset also includes the original article URL, date processed, headline, and SEO snippet. [h/t [Karsten Johansson](http://ksaj.inlisp.org)]
