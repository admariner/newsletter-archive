===================================

*Congressional campaign policy platforms, Billboard hits, EU antitrust cases, Texas oil and gas, and 100,000+ wines.*


__Congressional campaign policy platforms.__ [CampaignView](https://www.campaignview.org/), a project from [Rachel Porter et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05491-x), provides [43,000+ policy-platform points and 5,000+ biographical narratives](https://www.campaignview.org/download) of candidates for the US House of Representatives between 2018 and 2022. The information was collected from campaign websites “in real time a week before each state’s primary election,” cleaned, standardized, and categorized. For each platform point, the dataset and [searchable interface](https://www.campaignview.org/explore) indicate the candidate, the text of the policy point, its subheading on the campaign website, and a human-labeled [policy topic code](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05491-x/tables/2).


__Billboard hits.__ For his upcoming book, [Uncharted Territory: What Numbers Tell Us about the Biggest Hit Songs and Ourselves](https://bio.site/uncharted_territory), [Chris Dalla Riva](https://www.chrisdallariva.com/) has compiled a [dataset of all 1,100+ Billboard number one hits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j1AUgtMnjpFTz54UdXgCKZ1i4bNxFjf01ImJ-BqBEt0/edit?gid=1974823090#gid=1974823090) from 1958 to early 2025. For each song, the dataset includes information about the artists, songwriters, producers, and label; genre, time signature, keys, BPM, the presence of various instruments; song structure and lyrics; whether the song was entered into Eurovision; and much more. __Read more__: Chris’s music-through-data newsletter, [Can’t Get Much Higher](https://www.cantgetmuchhigher.com/).


__EU antitrust cases.__ The European Union’s [Directorate-General for Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate-General_for_Competition) has [begun](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eucompetitionpolicy_eucompetition-activity-7307743145721540609-6Egt/) publishing [case datasets](https://data.europa.eu/data/catalogues/comp), providing information about decades of [antitrust and cartel cases](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/18489cb7-bce7-4d44-a138-795b390d2109~~1?locale=en), [merger cases](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/cc7e224e-6569-40f0-8037-d3389aa0fae7~~1?locale=en), [Digital Markets Act cases](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/72358eb1-37aa-40bb-8047-d87154d57ac1~~2?locale=en), [subsidy cases](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/fa8d67be-d050-42a4-97ff-9e849805acf9~~1?locale=en), and more. The datasets generally provide the case title, companies involved, key dates, decision, and attachments, among other variables.


__Texas oil and gas.__ The [Railroad Commission of Texas](https://www.rrc.texas.gov/about-us/), the state’s “agency with primary regulatory jurisdiction over the oil and natural gas industry,” publishes [datasets](https://www.rrc.texas.gov/resource-center/research/data-sets-available-for-download/) of wells and pipelines, annual production by oil/gas field, permitted production, underground injection monitoring, and more. The commission also provides [query interfaces](https://www.rrc.texas.gov/resource-center/research/research-queries/#OilandGas) to many of its datasets. __As seen in__: “[The surprising transparency hidden inside the US oil and gas machine](https://blog.datadesk.eco/p/the-surprising-transparency-hidden)” ([Data Desk](https://blog.datadesk.eco/)).

__Wines and wine ratings.__ [Rogério Xavier de Azambuja et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/7/1/20)’s [X-Wines dataset](https://github.com/rogerioxavier/X-Wines) describes 100,000+ wines produced in 60+ countries. The dataset — collected and standardized from “wine-specialized websites,” winery websites, and other sources — indicates each wine’s name, type, grape varieties, alcohol level, acidity level, country, region, winery, and vintages. It also includes 21 million ratings (on a 1-to-5 scale) of those wines by 1 million anonymized users. __Previously__: [Databases from the Wine Economics Research Centre](https://economics.adelaide.edu.au/wine-economics/databases) ([DIP 2022.10.12](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-10-12-edition/)) and [France and Italy’s protected wines](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Quality_wines_in_Italy_and_France_a_dataset_of_protected_designation_of_origin_specifications/25393261?file=45062896) ([DIP 2024.05.22](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2024-05-22-edition/)).
