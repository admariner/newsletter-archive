*2020 election emails, civilian harm in Yemen, medical abbreviations, NYC constituent inquiries, and Forrest Gump-ology.*


__2020 election emails.__ To build the [Princeton Corpus of Political Emails](https://electionemails2020.org/), researchers auto-subscribed to thousands of mailing lists run by candidates, political parties, and other groups participating in the 2020 US election cycle. They’ve received 400,000+ messages so far. Since October, you’ve been able to search the corpus online; as of last month, you can [request access](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcgjZo-D1nNON4d90H2j0VLtTdxiHK6Y8HPJSpdRu4w5YILw/viewform) to v1.0 of its bulk dataset, which contains 300,000+ emails received through Election Day. For each, it provides the subject and body text, sender, office sought, and more. __Previously__: [Congressional e-newsletters](https://www.lindseycormack.com/dcinbox-data-downloads) via [DCinbox](https://www.dcinbox.com/) ([DIP 2021.03.03](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-03-03-edition/)), and political emails gathered [by The Markup](https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-wheres-my-email) and [by FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/candidate-emails) ([DIP 2020.03.04](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-03-04-edition/)).

__Civilian harm in Yemen.__ The UN-affiliated [Civilian Impact Monitoring Project](https://civilianimpactmonitoring.org/) [conducts](https://civilianimpactmonitoring.org/methodology) “real-time collection, analysis and dissemination of open source data on the civilian impact from armed violence in Yemen.” Its public datasets include the [monthly incident and casualty counts](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/yemen-civilian-impact-incidents-and-civilian-casualties) and the [incidents per region damaging various types of civilian infrastructure](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/yemen-impact-on-civilian-infrastructure). __Related__: [ACAPS](https://www.acaps.org/), a humanitarian analysis group, [is aggregating data](https://data.humdata.org/search?q=%22Yemen%20CrisisInSight%22&sort=title_case_insensitive%20desc) on a range of “key drivers” and outcomes of the crisis (such as fuel prices, malnutrition, and internal displacement) in each district and governorate. __Previously__: [The Yemen Data Project](https://yemendataproject.org/) ([DIP 2019.04.03](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-04-03-edition/)).

__Medical abbreviations.__ [Lisa Grossman Liu et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00929-4) have developed the [Medical Abbreviation and Acronym Meta-Inventory](https://github.com/lisavirginia/clinical-abbreviations/tree/master/metainventory), a database that maps 104,000+ medical abbreviations and acronyms to 170,000+ different meanings. To build it, the authors standardized data from [eight sources](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00929-4/tables/2), including the [Unified Medical Language System](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medical_abbreviations), and [ADAM: Another Database of Abbreviations in MEDLINE](http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/arrowsmith_uic/adam.html). __Related__: “[At our urban academic medical center, acronyms constituted 30–50% of the words in a typical medicine admission note.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046418302132)”


__NYC constituent inquiries.__ Many members of the New York City Council use [CouncilStat](https://council.nyc.gov/districts/data1/) to track their constituents’ requests, complaints, and other inquiries. The tool’s [public dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Council-Constituent-Services/9hzi-kbqb) contains 260,000+ anonymized entries going back to 2015. It identifies each inquiry’s topic (e.g., tax preparation, citizenship, affordable housing, street resurfacing), district, and dates opened and closed. __As seen in__: [A pre-election analysis of the requests](https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/6/15/22536020/nyc-city-council-constituent-service) by *The City*’s [Ann Choi](https://www.twitter.com/annjychoi).


__Forrest Gump-ology.__ [StudyForrest](https://www.studyforrest.org/) is “a one-of-a-kind resource for studying high-level cognition in the human brain under complex, natural stimulation.” Specifically: while watching *Forrest Gump*. In addition to fMRI scans and eye-tracking measurements, [the project’s datasets](https://www.studyforrest.org/data.html) include extensive annotations of the film itself, such as the [location and timing of each shot](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2273/v1).
