*Carbon pricing, UNICEF’s operations, community-moderated tweets, UK museums, and cattle brands.*


__Carbon pricing.__ In a [paper published last month](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01659-x), [Geoffroy Dolphin](http://geoffroydolphin.eu/) and [Qinrui Xiahou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qinrui-xiahou-13a211110/a) describe their [World Carbon Pricing Database](https://github.com/g-dolphin/WorldCarbonPricingDatabase). For each country (as well as each US state and certain other subnational jurisdictions), the database indicates the price per metric ton of [CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/27/co2e-global-warming-potential) associated with any carbon taxes and cap-and-trade mechanisms in place, for each year going back to 1990. It lists these prices for each combination of type of fuel and [sectoral classification](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/). __Previously__: The [Voluntary Registry Offsets Database](https://gspp.berkeley.edu/faculty-and-impact/centers/cepp/projects/berkeley-carbon-trading-project/offsets-database) and the [World Bank’s database of carbon pricing initiatives](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/map_data) ([DIP 2021.11.17](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-11-17-edition/)).


__UNICEF’s operations.__ The United Nations Children’s Fund is a signatory to the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](https://iatistandard.org/en/) and, as such, publishes [detailed data files](https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher/unicef) describing its programs and activities around the world. The files are organized by country, updated monthly, and follow [the initiative’s prescribed XML structure](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/). They list each program’s name, organizations involved, locations, dates, budgets, spending, results, and more. You can also use [UNICEF’s transparency portal](https://open.unicef.org/) to [explore the data by program focus and country](https://open.unicef.org/index.php/program-fund-goal).

__Community-moderated tweets.__ Twitter [recently expanded](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23390761/twitter-birdwatch-community-moderation-expansion-misinformation-qanon) its [Birdwatch](https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/) pilot program, which allows [certain users](https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/signing-up/) to anonymously “identify Tweets they believe are misleading, write notes that provide context to the Tweet, and rate the quality of other contributors’ notes.” The company provides [data on all submitted notes, ratings of notes, and note status histories](https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/overview/), though it requires you to be logged-in and US-based to [download the files](https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch/download-data). __As seen in__: “[COVID misinfo is the biggest challenge for Twitter’s Birdwatch program, data shows](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/10/23393021/twitter-birdwatch-covid-misinformation-data-analysis-misinformation-fact-check),” from The Verge’s [Corin Faife](https://twitter.com/corintxt), who has published an [interactive](https://theverge-bird-watch.herokuapp.com/Birdwatch/Birdwatch_Notes), [downloadable](https://theverge-bird-watch.herokuapp.com/Birdwatch) table of the notes.


__UK museums.__ The [Mapping Museums](https://museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/home) project has assembled a [searchable](https://museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/search), [browsable](https://museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/browseproperties), and [downloadable](https://museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/data) dataset of 4,000+ museums active in the United Kingdom between 1960 and 2020. It includes museums dedicated to art, war, local history, transport, drinks, and many other subjects. The records, [collected and refined from a range of sources](https://museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/sources), indicate each museum’s name, location, size (small, medium, large, huge), topic, year opened/closed, accreditation, type of governance, and more.


__Cattle brands.__ Kansas ranchers must register their [cattle-branding symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock_branding) with the state’s agriculture department. For decades, the department [published books listing all the registered brands](https://cdm16884.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/search/searchterm/A53-8-B817-part/order/dated/ad/asc), indexed using a custom coding system. [Mason Youngblood et al.](https://psyarxiv.com/h5t7b/) have assembled a [dataset of 90,000+ such entries](https://github.com/masonyoungblood/cattle_brand_data) from the 1990, 2008, 2014, 2015, and 2016 books. __Related__: “[Kansas Moves Cattle Brand Registration to the Cloud](https://www.govtech.com/computing/kansas-moves-cattle-brand-registration-to-the-cloud.html)” (GovTech).
