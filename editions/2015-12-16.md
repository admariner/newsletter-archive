Data Is Plural — 2015.12.16 edition
===================================

*Policing the police, inventorying the glaciers, fact-checking the politicians, paying the coaches, and not watching your language.*


__Policing the police.__ The Department of Justice is authorized to investigate police departments that display a “pattern or practice” of civil rights violations. In April, the Marshall Project began publishing [a spreadsheet of the DOJ investigations into local law enforcement](https://github.com/themarshallproject/doj14141/blob/master/data/doj_data.csv). The dataset, [which is updated regularly](https://github.com/themarshallproject/doj14141#the-department-of-justices-14141-civil-rights-investigations), indicates when each case began, when it ended, and what type of agreement (if any) was reached. The latest entry: An investigation into the Chicago Police Department, announced last week. __Related:__ [PBS Frontline's interactive map of DOJ investigations](http://apps.frontline.org/fixingtheforce/).

__All the world’s glaciers.__ [The recently-updated Randolph Glacier Inventory](http://www.glims.org/RGI/rgi50_dl.html) contains spreadsheets and outlines of every known glacier in the world. Of the 212,000+ glaciers inventoried, more than 27,000 are in Alaska. Someone please adopt [Deserted Glacier](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Deserted+Glacier,+Alaska+99686/@60.9786026,-145.6392684,7075m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x56b6f38f0ce35db9:0x1f9d53f4331c53fc).

__College coaching salaries.__ Last week, *USA Today* released its annual accounting of [assistant — yes, assistant — college football coaches’ salaries](http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/salaries/football/assistant). At $1.6 million per annum, Auburn’s Will Muschamp leads the pack. More than 371 assistants have salaries of $250,000+. The release complements the publication’s [database of head-coaching salaries](http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/salaries/football/coach). __Related:__ [Each state’s highest paid public employee, as of 2013-ish](http://deadspin.com/infographic-is-your-states-highest-paid-employee-a-co-489635228).

__Many pants on fire.__ You’ve probably heard of [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/), the *Tampa Bay Times* project that fact-checks what politician say. What you might not know: [PolitiFact has an API](http://static.politifact.com/api/v2apidoc.html). You can use it to fetch detailed data the project’s national and state-level editions. __Related:__ “[All Politicians Lie. Some Lie More Than Others](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/opinion/campaign-stops/all-politicians-lie-some-lie-more-than-others.html),” PolitiFact’s top editor writes in the New York Times.
