__US military bases and deployments.__ [Michael A. Allen et al.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/07388942211030885) are gathering and standardizing [data on the United States military’s global presence](https://github.com/meflynn/troopdata). The project’s [CSV files](https://github.com/meflynn/troopdata/tree/master/data-raw) and [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/troopdata/index.html) include annual, country-level troop counts between 1950 and 2020, drawn from [prior work](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/global-us-troop-deployment-1950-2003) by economist [Tim Kane](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/timothy-kane) and from the government’s [Defense Manpower Data Center](https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/dwp_reports.jsp). They also include a listing of US military bases abroad, primarily sourced from [*Base Nation*](https://www.basenation.us/), a book by political anthropologist [David Vine](https://www.davidvine.net/) (who, disclosure, is a cousin of mine). __Related__: Vine also maintains [various lists of US military bases abroad since 1776](https://dra.american.edu/islandora/object/auislandora:94927) and has published a follow-up book, [*The United States of War*](https://www.davidvine.net/unitedstatesofwar.html).

__Louisiana deaths behind bars.__ [Incarceration Transparency](https://www.incarcerationtransparency.org/), a project undertaken by law students and faculty at Loyola University New Orleans, has compiled data on [more than 830 deaths in Louisiana jails, prisons, and juvenile detention centers](https://www.incarcerationtransparency.org/?page_id=1425), primarily [between 2015 and 2019](https://www.incarcerationtransparency.org/?page_id=3837), based on 130+ public records requests. The information includes each decedent’s name, age, sex, race, and trial status; the date, facility, and cause of death; and other factors. __Read more__: [The New Yorker’s recent profile of the project and the professor leading it](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/23/a-fight-to-expose-the-hidden-human-costs-of-incarceration). __Previously__: [Deaths in US jails, via Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic/) ([DIP 2020.10.21](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-10-21-edition/)).


__A/B headline tests.__ [The Upworthy Research Archive](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00934-7) describes 32,000+ headline-testing experiments conducted in 2013–15 by [Upworthy](https://www.upworthy.com/), the online publication that [popularized a once-ubiquitous style of headline](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/06/20/533529538/upworthy-was-one-of-the-hottest-sites-ever-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next). [The dataset](https://osf.io/jd64p/), [contributed by the publication](https://natematias.medium.com/announcing-the-upworthy-research-archive-c9b11087ddeb) to [a team of academics](https://upworthy.natematias.com/), is split into three tranches for use in different phases of research. In total, it covers 150,000+ headline-plus-image permutations; for each, it provides the headline, an image identifier, the number of viewers assigned to see it, the number who clicked, [and other details](https://upworthy.natematias.com/about-the-archive).


__The Magazine of Early American Datasets.__ [MEAD](https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/), as the publication acronymizes itself, “provides sweet, intoxicating data for your investigations of early North America and the Atlantic World.” [The initiative](http://commonplace.online/article/constructing-the-magazine-of-early-american-datasets-mead-an-invitation-to-share-and-use-data-about-early-america/), affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, hosts a few dozen datasets on a range of topics; many focus on Pennsylvania and on slavery, while other subjects include [George Washington’s shipping invoices](https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/25/) and [the 19th century children’s book industry](https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/28/).

__Shows within shows.__ [Nestflix](https://nestflix.fun/), a new website by designer/developer [Lynn Fisher](https://lynnandtonic.com/), catalogs more than 400 fictional films and TV shows that appear within actual films and TV shows. For instance: 30 Rock’s [*The Rural Juror*](https://nestflix.fun/the-rural-juror/) and Home Alone’s [*Angels with Filthy Souls*](https://nestflix.fun/angels-with-filthy-souls/). The project [is open-source](https://github.com/lynnandtonic/nestflix.fun); the [data files for each item](https://github.com/lynnandtonic/nestflix.fun/tree/main/src/data) include the title, a description, a quotation, the parent show/film, and more.
