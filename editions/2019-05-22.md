Data Is Plural — 2019.05.22 edition
===================================

*Internet speeds, city finances, Canada’s high-court interveners, primates, and hyphenated names.*

&nbsp;

**Internet speeds.** The [Measurement Lab](https://www.measurementlab.net/) describes itself as “[the largest open source Internet measurement effort in the world](https://www.measurementlab.net/faq/).” Volunteers run [the lab’s tests](https://www.measurementlab.net/tests/) on their own devices, measuring their internet connection’s speed, latency, and other characteristics. The lab [then publishes the data it collects](https://www.measurementlab.net/data/), both [as raw output](https://www.measurementlab.net/data/docs/gcs/) and [as BigQuery tables](https://www.measurementlab.net/data/docs/bq/quickstart/). It also offers a [tool for charting internet speeds](https://viz.measurementlab.net/) by location and ISP, based on 240+ million tests generated from 87,000+ cities; you can access the data underlying any chart, and also [download the same aggregations directly](https://viz.measurementlab.net/data).

**City finances.** The [Fiscally Standardized Cities database](https://www.lincolninst.edu/research-data/data-toolkits/fiscally-standardized-cities) “makes it possible to compare local government finances for [150 of the largest U.S. cities](https://www.lincolninst.edu/research-data/data-toolkits/fiscally-standardized-cities/list-150-fiscs) across more than 120 categories of revenues, expenditures, debt, and assets.” The database, developed by [Adam Langley](https://www.lincolninst.edu/about-lincoln-institute/people/adam-h-langley) at the [Lincoln Institute of Land Policy](https://www.lincolninst.edu/), covers the years 1977 to 2016 and takes into account the ways in which finances and responsibilities overlap between cities, counties, school districts, and other local governments.

**The Supreme Court of Canada’s interveners.** At Canada’s highest court, “interveners” are the rough equivalent of amicus brief filers in U.S. Supreme Court cases. [Sancho McCann](https://sanchom.github.io/), a student at the University of British Columbia’s law school, has [created](https://github.com/sanchom/scc_stats) a [dataset of the past ten years of interveners](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zNUIDaw4Fd8H_zr-dZsIs8Si_8QlqPY6nIQGR8UzoVY/edit#gid=716506492) and has [analyzed it](https://sanchom.github.io/interveners-2009-2018.html). For each of the 665 cases from 2009 to 2018, the dataset includes the case name, the previous court, a couple of case classifications, and the names of the interveners (if any).

&nbsp;

**Primates.** A team of researchers at the [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico) have [aggregated the observations of 1,216 studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0059-9) into a [database describing 504 primate species](https://zenodo.org/record/2600338). The traits in the database include body mass, habitat, type of diet, conservation status, and more.

&nbsp;

**From Abdul-Aziz to Young-Malcolm.** The Pudding’s [Jan Diehm](https://twitter.com/jadiehm) has identified and analyzed [decades of hyphenated last names](https://pudding.cool/2019/05/hyphens/) in seven North American sports leagues: the MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL, MLS, WNBA, and NWSL. The code and data are [available to download](https://github.com/the-pudding/hyphenated-names). **Now you know:** Two ambi-hyphenates — Pierre-Luc Letourneau-Leblond and Jean-Luc Grand-Pierre — have played in the NHL (and none in any of other leagues).
