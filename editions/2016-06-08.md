Data Is Plural — 2016.06.08 edition
===================================

*Nuclear accidents, government court payouts, local justice data, the Netflix Prize, and chart-topping music.*


__Nuclear accidents.__ Researchers in Europe have published a [database of 216 nuclear energy accidents](https://innovwiki.ethz.ch/index.php/Nuclear_events_database) — a compendium they say is “[twice the size of the previous best data set](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.12587/full).” For each accident, the database contains the date, location, description, and four measurements of severity: its ratings on the [International Nuclear Event Scale](http://www-ns.iaea.org/tech-areas/emergency/ines.asp) and on the [Nuclear Accident Magnitude Scale](http://www.davidsmythe.org/nuclear/accidents.htm), the number of fatalities, and total monetary cost. (The three most expensive: Chernobyl, Fukushima, and a 1995 accident at Japan’s [Monju Nuclear Power Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monju_Nuclear_Power_Plant), estimated to have caused $15.5 billion in damages.)

__Government court payouts.__ The U.S. government maintains a “[judgment fund](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsservices/gov/pmt/jdgFund/judgementFund_home.htm),” which it uses to pay plaintiffs when federal agencies lose in court (or settle “actual or imminent lawsuits”). The Department of the Treasury, which administers the fund, publishes [data on these payouts](https://jfund.fms.treas.gov/jfradSearchWeb/JFPymtSearchAction.do) for each fiscal year going back to FY2006.

__Local justice data.__ The Sunlight Foundation’s [Hall of Justice](http://hallofjustice.sunlightfoundation.com/) brings together “nearly 10,000” criminal justice datasets and research documents from across the United States. You can search for topics and filter by geography, publisher, and accessibility (open, open-but-not-machine-readable, restricted access, et cetera.). __Related:__ Sunlight’s “[lessons learned from a year of opening police data](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/05/04/lessons-learned-from-a-year-of-opening-police-data/).” [h/t [Susie Cambria](https://twitter.com/susiecambria) + [Noah Veltman](https://twitter.com/veltman)]


__The Netflix Prize, archived.__ In 2006, Netflix launched a [$1 million challenge](http://www.netflixprize.com/) to beat the company’s movie-recommendation algorithm. In 2009, Netflix awarded the prize to a group of AT&T scientists ([though ultimately didn’t use the winning algorithm](https://www.techdirt.com/blog/innovation/articles/20120409/03412518422/why-netflix-never-implemented-algorithm-that-won-netflix-1-million-challenge.shtml)). The challenge, which was open to the public, was based on a dataset of 100 million ratings from 480,000 (anonymized) users, corresponding to more than 17,000 movies between Oct. 1998 and Dec. 2005. The dataset, [once hosted at UC Irvine](https://web.archive.org/web/20090925184737/http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Netflix+Prize), is [currently available through the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/nf_prize_dataset.tar). __Previously:__ [MovieLens](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), [featured Jan. 27](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-01-27-edition).

__*Billboard* hits and lyrics.__ Statistics grad student Kaylin Walker [scraped 50 years of *Billboard*’s “Year-End Hot 100” rankings and those songs’ lyrics](https://github.com/walkerkq/musiclyrics). __Related:__ [Walker’s analysis and methodology](http://kaylinwalker.com/50-years-of-pop-music/).
