Data Is Plural — 2017.08.30 edition
===================================

*Flood maps, redlining maps, home price indices, website logos, and Game of Thrones personalities.*

&nbsp;

**Flood maps.** [FEMA’s Flood Map Service Center](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/advanceSearch) publishes geospatial files that detail the agency’s flood risk assessments — both current and historical. The maps include flood zones, levee locations, “base flood elevations,” and more. **Helpful:** [FEMA’s technical documentation](https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/886edbc98e2229a90d0593d5e46ddac9/Flood+Insurance+Rate+Map+Database+Technical+Reference.pdf). **Related:** “[Why Houston Isn’t Ready for Harvey](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/harvey),” published last week by ProPublica and The Texas Tribune; and “[Hell and High Water](https://projects.propublica.org/houston/),” the reporting team’s deep dive on Houston last year. **Previously:** [The most comprehensive global dataset of cyclone paths](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-04-19-edition) (DIP 2017.04.19).

&nbsp;

**Redlining.** The [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/) project has digitized more than 150 of the “security maps” produced by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation between 1935 and 1940. Together, the maps “offer a view of Depression-era America as developers, realtors, tax assessors, and surveyors saw it — a set of interlocking color-lines, racial groups, and environmental risks.” To download the data for a given map, click on the cloud icon in the top-right corner. **Related:** [A new research paper](https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2017/wp2017-12), by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, uses the data to quantify redlining’s lasting effects. **Also related:** [The New York Times’ summary of the data and research](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/upshot/how-redlinings-racist-effects-lasted-for-decades.html).

**Home price indices.** The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis publishes [S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release?rid=199), which measures changes in average home prices over time. The monthly-updated datasets — copyrighted, but free to download — are available at a national and metro-area level, and go back several decades.

&nbsp;

**Website logos.** Favicons are the little square icons in your browser’s tabs, placed there by the websites you’ve loaded. Two recent projects attempted to collect these markers from the web’s million most-trafficked domains. One, by programmer Colin Morris, collected [360,000 favicons in July 2016](https://archive.org/details/favicons_201708). The second, by researchers at ETH Zurich, collected [548,00 favicons in April 2017](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/lld/). **Semi-related:** Morris’s “[Finding bad flamingo drawings with recurrent neural networks](https://colinmorris.github.io/blog/bad_flamingos)”; the analysis uses [Google’s 50-million-doodles](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data) data, [featured in DIP 2017.05.04](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-05-24-edition).

&nbsp;

**Game of Thrones characters, judged.** Earlier this month, The New York Times [asked readers to rate 50 of the show’s most recognizable characters](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/09/upshot/game-of-thrones-chart.html) along two dimensions: good ↔ evil, and ugly ↔ beautiful. They’ve received 190,000+ submissions. The results are accessible as two JSON files: [one for the averages](https://int.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/2017-07-17-got-matrix/mean.json) and [another for the distributions](https://int.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/2017-07-17-got-matrix/contours.json).
