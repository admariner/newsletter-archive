===================================

*Refugees resettled in the US, Arizona migrant deaths, Canadian candidates, NBER working papers, and lightning intensity.*


*üëã üìÖ Data Is Plural will be taking a short break, with plans to return in August.*


__Refugees resettled in the US.__ [Axel Dreher et al.](https://www.refugeeresettlementdata.com/) have published [person-level data on 2.5+ million refugees](https://www.refugeeresettlementdata.com/data.html) who arrived in the US between 1975 and 2008. The anonymized records, obtained from the [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/) and originally collected by the [Office of Refugee Resettlement](https://acf.hhs.gov/orr), indicate each refugee‚Äôs country and date of birth, marital and family status, education level and English proficiency, date of US arrival, US city of resettlement, and more. The researchers also combined these records with public reports from the [Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration](https://www.wrapsnet.org/) ([DIP 2015.11.25](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2015-11-25-edition/)) to create a geocoded dataset of annual resettlements by citizenship and destination city from 1975 to 2018.

__Arizona migrant deaths.__ The [Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants](https://humaneborders.info/) is a collaboration between [Pima County‚Äôs Office of the Medical Examiner](https://webcms.pima.gov/government/medical_examiner/) and [Humane Borders](https://humaneborders.org/), a nonprofit that [maintains water stations in the Sonoran Desert](https://humaneborders.org/water-stations/). ‚ÄúAlthough each organization has a distinct mission, both are committed to the common vision of raising awareness about migrant deaths and lessening the suffering of families by helping to provide closure through the identification of the deceased and the return of remains.‚Äù The initiative‚Äôs [maps and dataset](https://humaneborders.info/app/map.asp) provide details on 3,700+ deaths since 1990, including the deceased‚Äôs name, sex, age, and cause of death; their body‚Äôs location and condition; and the date reported.

__Canadian candidates.__ PhD candidate [Semra Sevi](https://semrasevi.com/) recently [compiled](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-of-political-science-revue-canadienne-de-science-politique/article/abs/who-runs-canadian-federal-and-ontario-provincial-candidates-from-1867-to-2019/2B18F0CB2DA35529340386C548750FC4) a [dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ABFNSQ) of 44,000+ candidates for Canadian federal office from 1867 to 2019 (and similar for Ontario provincial candidates). It lists each candidate‚Äôs name, gender, birth year, occupation, party, and incumbency status, plus the election‚Äôs date, riding, and outcome. And a [new dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MI5XQ6) from [Anna Johnson et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-of-political-science-revue-canadienne-de-science-politique/article/abs/new-dataset-on-the-demographics-of-canadian-federal-election-candidates/62FE243F387DA88718C825961AB24C10) delves into the demographics of 4,516 Canadian federal candidates from 2008 to 2019, including their gender, age, race, Indigenous background, occupational category, and more.

__NBER working papers.__ Since 1973, the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/)‚Äôs [1,500+ affiliated researchers](https://www.nber.org/about-nber) have published 29,000+ (pre-peer review) articles through the organization‚Äôs [working papers series](https://www.nber.org/papers). It [provides structured information about each paper](https://www2.nber.org/RePEc/nbr/nberwo/), using [a template](https://ideas.repec.org/t/papertemplate.html) from the [RePEc project](http://repec.org/). PhD student [Ben Davies](https://bldavies.com/) has [converted those files](https://bldavies.com/blog/introducing-nberwp/) into [CSV tables and an R package](https://github.com/bldavies/nberwp) listing each paper‚Äôs title, publication month, ID, and authors. [h/t [Alex Albright](https://scholar.harvard.edu/apalbright/home)]


__Lightning intensity.__ The [World Wide Lightning Location Network](https://wwlln.net/) uses radio sensors to detect the location and power of 200+ million lightning strokes per year. Access to WWLLN‚Äôs raw, detailed data costs money but earth scientists [Jed O. Kaplan](http://web.hku.hk/~jkaplan/) and [Katie Hong-Kiu Lau](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katie-Hong-Kiu-Lau) have [converted it](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/3219/2021/) into a few public-access [gridded-globe timeseries of lightning activity from 2010 to 2020](https://zenodo.org/record/4882792) ‚Äî daily and monthly strokes per km<sup>2</sup>, and monthly stroke power.
