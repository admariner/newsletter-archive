===================================

*The Freedman‚Äôs Bank, recreational boating accidents, Western water rights, real-time UK voter registrations, and watching grass grow.*


*üì¨ Reader [Alexandra F](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shymanskaya-data-science/) has used the [ancient shipwreck data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11fk5YeQ4eFOnYSBNpUdHp4TP42gJ7wY5/edit?gid=970169931#gid=970169931) featured in [DIP 2024.07.10](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2024-07-10-edition/) to build a [series of maps](https://medium.com/@alexandrafiona/unveiling-ancient-maritime-history-a-data-driven-journey-through-shipwrecks-across-time-and-space-1249b39fca67) for each historical sub-period.

__The Freedman‚Äôs Bank.__ The [Freedman‚Äôs Savings and Trust Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman%27s_Savings_Bank) was chartered by Congress in 1865, toward the end of the Civil War, to provide banking services to formerly enslaved Americans. ‚ÄúThough the bank achieved some early successes, it failed catastrophically in 1874, destroying the savings of a broad swath of newly freed black citizens,‚Äù write [Malcolm Wardlaw](https://www.malcolmwardlaw.info/) and [Virginia Traweek](https://www.virginiatraweek.com/), who have [constructed several datasets](https://freedmansbank.uga.edu/) based on handwritten records preserved by the federal government. One dataset lists [5,000+ transactions](https://freedmansbank.uga.edu/project/passbooks/) from 500+ accounts‚Äô ‚Äúpassbooks‚Äù, indicating the account holder, city, transaction type, date, and amount. Another lists [40,000+ accounts‚Äô final balances](https://freedmansbank.uga.edu/project/dividendrecord/) at the time of the bank‚Äôs failure. __Read more__: [Wardlaw and Traweek‚Äôs studies analyzing the records](https://freedmansbank.uga.edu/#publications).


__Recreational boating accidents.__ In the US, recreational boaters [must notify state authorities](https://uscgboating.org/recreational-boaters/accident-reporting.php) soon after any incident involving a death, serious injury, disappearance, or substantial damage. The authorities relay those notifications to the Coast Guard, which stores them in its centralized [Boating Accident Report Database](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhsuscgpia-011-boating-accident-report-database-bard). The [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/) (which, customary disclosure, I run) [filed a FOIA request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/uscg-boating-accident-report-database/) for the database and, earlier this week, [published](https://buttondown.com/data-liberation-project/archive/dlp-dispatch-17/) the [records it received](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/uscg-boating-accident-report-database/). The data describe 58,000+ boating accidents, 78,000+ vessels, 8,900+ deaths, and 36,000+ injuries from 2009 to 2023, although a few states and territories withheld their incidents from disclosure. __Read more__: [The Data Liberation Project‚Äôs introductory documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lk0dnACzcj3Yo6DAjZbGKf_zFYkymor5IDwNxypnZpc/edit).


__Western water rights.__ [Matthew D. Lisk et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03434-6) have compiled and standardized a [dataset of water rights records](https://data.msdlive.org/records/dfkx0-hew78) ‚Äî key documents in the allocation of the scarce resource ‚Äî in the Western United States. Drawing on [raw data](https://data.msdlive.org/records/8y9nq-bdt52) collected from 11 states, the [harmonized dataset](https://data.msdlive.org/records/h79e1-k3h91) ‚Äúprovides consistent unique identifiers for each spatial unit of water management across the domain, unique identifiers for each water right record, and a consistent categorization scheme that puts each water right record into one of 7 broad use categories.‚Äù Those categories: irrigation, domestic, livestock, fish, industrial, environmental, and other. The authors have also published a [set of shapefiles outlining each water management area‚Äôs boundaries](https://data.msdlive.org/records/v5ree-qj344). 


__Real-time UK voter registrations.__ The UK government‚Äôs [voter registration statistics dashboard](https://www.registertovote.service.gov.uk/performance) updates hundreds of times per day. It provides downloadable data on [the number of online applications in each five-minute interval in the past 24 hours](https://www.registertovote.service.gov.uk/performance/live_usage) and daily counts broken down by [online vs. paper applications](https://www.registertovote.service.gov.uk/performance/applications_breakdown), [age group](https://www.registertovote.service.gov.uk/performance/applications_by_age_group), [elector type](https://www.registertovote.service.gov.uk/performance/applications_by_type), and [nation](https://www.registertovote.service.gov.uk/performance/applications_by_nation).

__Watching grass grow.__ The [Jornada Experimental Range](https://jornada.nmsu.edu/), [run by](https://jornada.nmsu.edu/about) the USDA‚Äôs Agricultural Research Service, ‚Äúis one of the longest serving laboratories focused on rangelands and drylands in the world.‚Äù Located north of Las Cruces, N.M., the site has operating since the 1910s. A few years ago, [Erica Christensen et al.](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3530) published a [dataset of grass and shrub growth](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-jrn.210351004.2) within 122 one-meter-by-one-meter squares on the range from 1915 to 2016, containing roughly 200,000 observations.
