Data Is Plural — 2020.08.12 edition
===================================

*Coronavirus humanitarian funding, US climate change, international banking statistics, electric vehicle charging, and 44 million Reddit votes.*


__Coronavirus humanitarian funding.__ The [Centre for Disaster Protection](https://www.disasterprotection.org/) and [Development Initiatives](https://devinit.org/) have been jointly compiling [data](https://www.disasterprotection.org/funding-covid-19-response) on the [billions of dollars of humanitarian and development aid](https://www.disasterprotection.org/latest-news/funding-covid-19-response-tracking-global-humanitarian-and-development-flows-to-meet-crisis-needs) that the IMF, World Bank, and other agencies have allocated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For each “flow” of funds, the dataset specifies the funding source, amount, approval date, purpose, and more. __Related__: The UN’s provides a [downloadable and explorable dataset](https://pfbi.unocha.org/COVID19/) of its coronavirus–related humanitarian funding, and [has built](https://centre.humdata.org/covid-19-map-explorer-whats-included-and-how-we-built-it/) an [interactive map based on these and related datasets](https://data.humdata.org/visualization/covid19-humanitarian-operations/).


__US climate change.__ On Friday, the Washington Post [released](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/08/07/how-use-posts-climate-data-analysis/) several [datasets and computer scripts](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-2C-beyond-the-limit-usa/) from its [Pulitzer Prize–winning](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staff-washington-post) series, “[2°C: Beyond the Limit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/climate-environment/climate-change-america/),” which examined how “extreme climate change has arrived in America.” The data files — derived from NOAA’s [nClimDiv](https://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00005) and [nClimGrid](https://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00332) climate datasets — contain the annual average temperatures and seasonal temperature changes for each state and county in the contiguous US.


__International banking statistics.__ The [Bank for International Settlements](https://www.bis.org/about/index.htm), established in 1930 and run by [a group of central banks](https://www.bis.org/about/member_cb.htm), publishes a [range of statistical datasets](https://www.bis.org/statistics/index.htm) “designed to inform analysis of financial stability, international monetary spillovers and global liquidity.” The datasets are available to [explore online](https://stats.bis.org/statx/toc/LBS.html) and to [download](https://www.bis.org/statistics/full_data_sets.htm); they cover exchange rates, cross-border liabilities, consumer prices, debt service ratios, and more.

__Electric vehicle charging.__ A team led by public policy professor [Omar Asensio](https://spp.gatech.edu/people/person/omar-isaac-asensio) used a field experiment to collect [data on 3,395 electric vehicle charging sessions](https://github.com/asensio-lab/workplace-charging-experiment). The [dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/NFPQLW) “contains sessions from 85 EV drivers with repeat usage at 105 stations across 25 sites at a workplace charging program”; it indicates the date and length of each session, total energy used, cost, and more.


__44 million Reddit votes.__ On Reddit, users can choose to publicize their history of upvoting and downvoting other users’ posts. Software engineer [Joey Leake](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joey-leake-83229b1/) recently [collected](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/hzdkbp/a_huge_collection_of_reddit_voting_data/) and [published](https://www.kaggle.com/josephleake/huge-collection-of-reddit-votes/) data on more than 44 million of these votes. For each, Leake’s dataset lists the post ID, relevant subreddit, the vote’s timestamp (in most cases), and the voter’s username.
