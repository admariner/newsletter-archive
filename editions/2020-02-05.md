Data Is Plural — 2020.02.05 edition
===================================

*Credibly accused clergy, coronavirus cases, sign-stealing, hotel bookings, and the Smiths (... and the Johnsons ... and the Williamses ...).*


__Credibly accused clergy.__ Reporters at ProPublica [have assembled](https://www.propublica.org/article/we-assembled-the-only-nationwide-database-of-priests-deemed-credibly-accused-of-abuse-heres-how) the first-ever [nationwide database of US Catholic clergy “credibly accused” of sexual abuse](https://projects.propublica.org/credibly-accused/), based on nearly 180 official lists released by dioceses and religious orders. (The majority of the lists were published during the past year and a half, following a [landmark grand jury report in Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury_investigation_of_Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_in_Pennsylvania).) The database contains more than 6,700 names so far, plus details available from some of the lists, including birth year, ordination year, assignments, and status.


__Coronavirus cases.__ As the [Wuhan coronavirus outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak) intensifies, a team at Johns Hopkins has been [mapping the number of confirmed cases](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6), deaths, and recoveries. The project [aggregates data](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/) from several sources, including the [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/), [US CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html), [European CDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases), and [DXY](https://ncov.dxy.cn/), a website that reports case counts from China’s CDC and National Health Commission. The dataset powering the Johns Hopkins map is [available as a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wQVypefm946ch4XDp37uZ-wartW4V7ILdg-qYiDXUHM/edit#gid=787605648).

__Baseball sign-stealing.__ “I’m an Astros fan. They cheated during the 2017 regular season — the evidence is clear. In an attempt to understand the scope of the cheating and the players involved, I decided to listen to every pitch from the Astros’ 2017 home games and log any banging noise I could detect.” That’s from [Tony Adams](https://twitter.com/adams_at), who [analyzed audio spectrograms](http://signstealingscandal.com/about/) corresponding to more than 8,200 pitches. Last week, he published [a website documenting his findings](http://signstealingscandal.com/), including [a spreadsheet of the data](http://signstealingscandal.com/files/). __Related__: [Adams’s list of stories and analyses that have used the data](http://signstealingscandal.com/statistical-analysis/).

__Hotel bookings.__ In 2018, a trio of researchers at the Instituto Universitário de Lisboa published a [dataset detailing nearly 120,000 (anonymized) bookings](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) at two (unnamed) hotels in Portugal between July 2015 and August 2017. The bookings, extracted from the hotels’ property management systems, are described in detail: the number of adults, children, and babies for the reservation; country of origin; customer, room, and deposit types; whether the guests were repeat visitors; the number of special requests made; and more.


__Last (but not least) names.__ From the US Census Bureau, you can download a dataset of [all surnames that belonged to at least 100 people in 2010](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2010_surnames.html), and [the same for 2000](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2000_surnames.html). Those datasets indicate the total number of people with the name, and distribution of those people by race/ethnicity. A similar list, but based on a sample population and without demographic information, is also [available for 1990](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/1990_census/1990_census_namefiles.html). __Pop quiz__: Try to guess the five most popular surnames that are also colors ... in order.
