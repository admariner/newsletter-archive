Data Is Plural — 2017.11.08 edition
===================================

*Where guns come from, tech diversity, rent-to-own prices, Indian movie theaters, and the friends of Friends.*


__Gun origins.__ The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) [helps trace guns](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/national-tracing-center) — such as those recovered at crime scenes by law enforcement agencies — back to their original manufacturers, wholesale distributors, dealers, and purchasers. Each year, ATF publishes a [range of datasets based on these gun traces](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/data-statistics). The [datasets for 2016](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/firearms-trace-data-2016) provide state-by-state tallies of gun caliber, state of original purchase, possessors’ age, associated crime, and more. __Related:__ “[Gun Laws Stop At State Lines, But Guns Don’t](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-laws-stop-at-state-lines-but-guns-dont/),” from FiveThirtyEight, using the data. __Also related:__ “[How a Gun Trace Works](https://www.thetrace.org/2016/07/how-a-gun-trace-works-atf-ffl/),” from The Trace. __Previously:__ [Firearm background checks](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2015-12-09-edition) (DIP 2015.12.09), which my colleague Peter Aldhous analyzed last week, finding that [gun sales did not spike after the Las Vegas shooting](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/gun-sales-after-vegas-shooting).


__Silicon Valley diversity.__ Reporters at the Center for Investigative Reporting [asked 200+ of the largest Silicon Valley tech companies](https://www.revealnews.org/article/hidden-figures-how-silicon-valley-keeps-diversity-data-secret/) for their official diversity data. Specifically, [the reporters requested each company’s latest EEO-1](https://www.revealnews.org/article/how-we-analyzed-silicon-valley-tech-companies-diversity-data/), the detailed demographic report that every large U.S. employer must submit to the federal government. [Only 23 companies shared their data](https://apps.revealnews.org/silicon-valley-diversity-list/). For those that did, their numbers are [now available as a tidy spreadsheet](https://github.com/cirlabs/Silicon-Valley-Diversity-Data). [h/t [Sophie Chou](http://sophiechou.com/)]


__Rent-to-own prices.__ As part of [NerdWallet’s recent investigation into Rent-A-Center](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/rentacenter/), “the nation’s largest rent-to-own company,” reporters compiled [pricing data for 39 consumer products on rentacenter.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/rent-a-center-methodology/). For each product, the dataset lists the various Rent-A-Center costs (e.g., installment fees for weekly/monthly payment plans, cash prices, et cetera) in each of 48 states and D.C. — plus prices for the same product at standard online retailers. __Related:__ [NerdWallet’s analysis of the data](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/rent-a-center-prices/).


__Indian movie theaters.__ Over at BuzzFeed India, Harsha Devulapalli and Janak Jain have [crowned Hyderabad the best city in India for going to the movies](https://www.buzzfeed.com/harshadevulapalli/whats-the-best-city-in-india-to-watch-a-movie), based on their analysis of nearly 600 theaters in eight major cities. The [underlying dataset](https://github.com/HarshaDevulapalli/indian-movie-theatres) lists each theater’s location, name, average ticket price (where available), number of screens, and number of seats.


__The friends of Friends.__ A few years ago, economist Alex Albright and a friend transcribed [the plotline-sharing dynamics of *Friends*’ six friends, across all 236 episodes](https://github.com/apalbright/Friends). In the very first episode (“The One Where Monica Gets a Roommate”), Monica and Rachel each have their own plotline; Rachel and Ross share a plotline; and Chandler, Joey, and Ross share another plotline. __Related:__ [Albright’s analysis of the data](https://thelittledataset.com/2015/01/20/the-one-with-all-the-quantifiable-friendships/).
