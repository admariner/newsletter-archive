*Slaveholders in Congress, pension plans, journal editors, radio on the internet, and chocolate bar reviews.*


*üëã Some updates: After nearly eight (very fulfilling) years as BuzzFeed News‚Äô data editor, I‚Äôm shifting roles there ‚Äî I‚Äôll be working part-time (for now) on a new initiative that I‚Äôm quite excited about. More details on that soonish. In the meantime, two related developments: ‚ú® [we‚Äôre hiring a new data editor](https://boards.greenhouse.io/buzzfeed/jobs/3758781?gh_jid=3758781) ‚ú® (ask me about it!) and I‚Äôve added a ‚ú® [job board](https://www.data-is-plural.com/jobs) ‚ú® to Data Is Plural (see below).*


__Slaveholders in Congress.__ At least ‚Äú1,715 members of Congress were enslavers at some point in their adult lives,‚Äù according to a [Washington Post investigation published Monday](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/congress-slaveowners-names-list/). Reporter [Julie Zauzmer Weil](https://twitter.com/juliezweil) began her research with a list of [every person who ever served in the House or Senate](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators), filtered it to those born before 1840, and then consulted [their biographies](https://bioguide.congress.gov/), Census records, and other historical documents. The Post‚Äôs [public dataset](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-congress-slaveowners/), the first of its kind, lists the congressmen from that era, their dates of birth, positions held in Congress, states served, dates served, and whether the Post determined they were slaveholders. For 677 of the congressmen, the Post ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt reach a conclusion‚Äù and [is seeking assistance from readers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/submit-congress-enslaved-database/).


__Pension plans.__ [Public Plans Data](https://publicplansdata.org/), a [collaboration](https://publicplansdata.org/about/our-research) led by Boston College professor [Alicia H. Munnell](https://publicplansdata.org/about/bios/munnell/), gathers extensive information about the retirement plans that state and local governments offer their employees, drawn from [those plans‚Äô annual financial reports](https://publicplansdata.org/resources/download-avs-cafrs/). The project maintains a [range of datasets](https://publicplansdata.org/public-plans-database/download-full-data-set/), including two decades of participation and financial figures for 200+ plans that account for ‚Äú95 percent of public pension membership and assets nationwide,‚Äù their investments, early payout options, and more. It also provides [interactive tools](https://publicplansdata.org/resources/interactive-tools/) and [an API](https://publicplansdata.org/public-plans-database/api/).


__Journal editors.__ For his [Open Editors](https://openeditors.ooir.org/) project, [Andreas Nishikawa-Pacher](https://twitter.com/andrepacher) scrapes the websites of scholarly journals, extracting the names, affiliations, and roles of their listed editors and board members. The [project‚Äôs dataset](https://github.com/andreaspacher/openeditors) contains half a million associations between editors and 6,000+ scholarly journals from 22 publishers (17 mainstream and 5 ‚Äú[predatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_publishing)‚Äù). __Read more__: [Nishikawa-Pacher et al.‚Äôs introductory working paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jvzq7/). __And__: ‚Äú[Why researchers created a database of half a million journal editors](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/researchers-created-database-half-million-journal-open-editors)‚Äù (Nature Index, 2021).


__Radio on the internet.__ [Radio-browser.info](https://www.radio-browser.info/) is ‚Äúa community driven effort (like wikipedia) with the aim of collecting as many internet radio and TV stations as possible.‚Äù The 29,000+ stations span [200+ countries](https://www.radio-browser.info/countries) and [280+ languages](https://www.radio-browser.info/languages). You can explore them on [a map](https://www.radio-browser.info/map), through [an API](https://api.radio-browser.info/), and via [bulk database snapshots](https://backups.radio-browser.info/).

__Chocolate bar reviews.__ The [Manhattan Chocolate Society](http://flavorsofcacao.com/mcs_index.html)‚Äôs [Brady Brelinski](http://flavorsofcacao.com/contact.html) has [reviewed](http://flavorsofcacao.com/review_guide.html) 2,500+ bars of craft chocolate since 2006, and compiles his findings into a [copy-paste-able table](http://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html) that lists each bar‚Äôs manufacturer, bean origin, percent cocoa, ingredients, review notes, and numerical rating. __Related__: [Craft chocolate makers in the US](http://flavorsofcacao.com/usa_craft_makers.html) and [Canada](http://flavorsofcacao.com/canadian_craft_makers.html), also compiled by Brelinski.
