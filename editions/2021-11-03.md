Data Is Plural — 2021.11.03 edition
===================================

*Internet shutdowns, concealed carry licensing, Amazon search results, FOIA reading rooms, and spiders.*


__Internet shutdowns.__ A [coalition](https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton-faq/) organized by [Access Now](https://www.accessnow.org/about-us/), a nonprofit that “defends and extends the digital rights of users at risk around the world,” has been gathering [data on intentional internet shutdowns](https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/). It has identified 155 shutdowns in 2020 and 50 in January–May 2021, based on information from a range of sources, including news reports and other trackers, such as the India-focused [internetshutdowns.in](https://internetshutdowns.in/). The datasets indicate the type of shutdown, start and end dates, geographic scope, who ordered it, public justifications, affected networks, and more. __As seen in__: “[Internet shutdowns have become a weapon of repressive regimes](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/10/15/internet-shutdowns-have-become-a-weapon-of-repressive-regimes)” (The Economist).


__Concealed carry licenses.__ To construct his [Concealed Carry Weapons License Database](https://socsteidley.com/2021/10/13/introducing-the-concealed-carry-weapons-license-database/), sociologist [Trent Steidley](https://socsteidley.com/) [spent](https://twitter.com/socsteidley/status/1448489666605240322) “over a year collecting data from 28 states using public records requests and cleaning into a state and county-year format.” The [published files](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/149062/version/V1/view?path=/openicpsr/149062/fcr:versions/V1&type=project) include the raw data, cleaned data, and documentation. The details vary by state, but can include the number of licenses held, issued, denied, revoked, and/or suspended, among other statuses; in some instances, the numbers are also disaggregated by demographic. For most states, the records stretch back to the early 2000s, some even earlier.


__Amazon search results.__ A [recent Markup investigation](https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products) “found that Amazon places products from its house brands and products exclusive to the site ahead of those from competitors — even competitors with higher customer ratings and more sales, judging from the volume of reviews.” Reporters [Adrianne Jeffries](https://adriannejeffries.com/) and [Leon Yin](https://www.leonyin.org/) published [their methodology](https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/how-we-analyzed-amazons-treatment-of-its-brands-in-search-results), as well as the [underlying code and data](https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-amazon-brands), which includes product-placement information relating 12,000+ search queries, details about 157,000+ products, raw HTML, and more.


__FOIA reading rooms.__ Data librarian [Lisa DeLuca](https://twitter.com/ldeluca1101) has compiled a [spreadsheet of 300+ Freedom of Information Act libraries](https://library.shu.edu/FOIA-Libraries), the online reading rooms where federal agencies [must post](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-guide-2004-edition-foia-reading-rooms) certain records, including those that “are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records.” DeLuca’s spreadsheet, [originally published in 2019](https://works.bepress.com/lisa_deluca/40/) and [updated last week](https://twitter.com/ldeluca1101/status/1453776389941960708), lists the agency’s name, its parent agency, and the portal’s name and URL.

__Spiders.__  The [World Spider Catalog](https://wsc.nmbe.ch/) is “the first fully searchable online database covering spider taxonomy,” with a [bulk dataset](https://wsc.nmbe.ch/dataresources) that lists [49,000+ species](https://wsc.nmbe.ch/statistics/), their geographic distributions, and author-year citations. [Stano Pekár et al.](https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baab064/6397506)’s [World Spider Trait database](https://spidertraits.sci.muni.cz/) [collates](https://spidertraits.sci.muni.cz/about) “individual measurements, observations, or composite characteristics,” such as body length, web diameter, and number of egg sacs produced.
