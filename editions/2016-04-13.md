Data Is Plural — 2016.04.13 edition
===================================

*Rainfall, legal opinions, inequality in health, inequality in Hollywood, and registered aircraft.*


__Global rainfall.__ To create [the most detailed measurements of global rainfall ever](http://chg.geog.ucsb.edu/data/chirps/index.html), researchers at UC Santa Barbara’s Climate Hazards Group harmonize data from satellites and on-the-ground weather stations. The dataset, known as *CHIRPS*, stretches back more than 30 years and is freely available. __Related:__ [Eric Holthaus provides more details and explains why the dataset is so important](http://ensia.com/features/this-new-data-set-is-poised-to-revolutionize-climate-adaptation/).

__Order in the courts.__ CourtListener gathers and [publishes bulk data](https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-info/) the Supreme Court, all federal appeals courts, and hundreds of other jurisdictions. The files include opinions, audio from oral arguments, dockets, and citations. It also [has an API](https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/). (If you register, you can also create and [explore networks of citation-linked cases](https://www.courtlistener.com/visualizations/scotus-mapper/).)

__Health and wealth.__ The [Health Inequality Project](https://healthinequality.org/) calculates American life expectancies by income, gender, and geography. You can [download the data](https://healthinequality.org/data/) at the national, state, county, and “commuting zone” levels. Where do poor Americans live the longest? [New York City, Santa Barbara, and San Jose](https://healthinequality.org/rankings/).

__He said, she said (less).__ Over the weekend, Hannah Anderson and Matt Daniels published an interactive analysis of [male and female speaking roles in 2,000 movie scripts](http://polygraph.cool/films/). Among their findings: 308 scripts gave 90%+ of the film’s dialogue to men, while just 8 scripts did so for women. The duo has also released “as much data as we can share (without getting sued)” [on GitHub](https://github.com/matthewfdaniels/scripts/).


__Plane papers.__ The Federal Aviation Administration maintains a [database of all non-military aircraft registrations](http://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download/), which includes extensive details about each plane/helicopter/glider/blimp and their owners. __Related:__ “[Spies In The Skies](http://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/spies-in-the-skies).” [h/t [Peter Aldhous](https://twitter.com/paldhous)]
