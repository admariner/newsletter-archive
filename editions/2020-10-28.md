===================================

*Pregnancy/birth/abortion rates, COVID-19 in ICE facilities, mining areas, e-bike/scooter laws, and witch trials.*


__Pregnancy, birth, and abortion.__ Last month the Guttmacher Institute, a “research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights,” [released](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/pregnancies-births-abortions-in-united-states-1973-2016#) its [latest estimates of annual pregnancies, births, and abortions](https://osf.io/kthnf/) among women in the US — overall, and also by [age-group and state](https://guttinst.github.io/National-State-Pregnancy-Codebook/). The national statistics cover 1973 to 2016, while the state-level numbers go from 1988 to 2016; both sets of estimates are derived from a combination of government data and the institute’s own [Abortion Provider Census](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/abortion-incidence-service-availability-us-2017). __Related__: [An introductory Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Imaddowzimet/status/1313501719406555138).

__COVID-19 in ICE facilities.__ Since late March, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been [updating a webpage](https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus) that tallies coronavirus cases and deaths at each of its detention facilities. But the site doesn’t provide any historical numbers; it’s just a snapshot. To fill that gap, the [Vera Institute of Justice](https://www.vera.org/) has been continually downloading the webpage, parsing it, and [turning the information into structured, longitudinal data](https://github.com/vera-institute/ice-detention-covid). __Related:__ Over the summer, [Vera used the data to estimate “the true scope” of COVID-19 in ICE detention](https://www.vera.org/the-hidden-curve-covid-19-in-ice-detention), and called on the agency to provide more detailed statistics.


__Mining areas.__ A team of academics has built a [dataset](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.910894) and [map](https://www.fineprint.global/visualisations/viewer/) indicating the [geographic extents of 6,000+ mining sites around the world](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00624-w). The project traces out 21,000+ polygons covering 57,000+ square kilometers, with boundaries based on experts’ visual interpretation of satellite imagery. It focuses on “above-ground features,” such as “open cuts, tailings dams, waste rock dumps, water ponds, and processing infrastructure.”


__E-bike and e-scooter laws.__ A dataset of [state regulations pertaining to standard bicycles, electric bicycles, and electric scooters](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/W9NGI2) accompanies [a recent paper in the Journal of Law and Mobility](https://repository.law.umich.edu/jlm/vol2020/iss1/2/). It includes various classifications for each state — indicating, for instance, whether riders can use the sidewalk, whether adults must wear helmets, and whether DUI laws apply.


__Witch trials.__ Some years ago, economists [Peter T. Leeson](https://economics.gmu.edu/people/pleeson) and [Jake Russ](https://www.jakeruss.com/) compiled a [dataset of 10,000+ witch trials in Europe](https://github.com/JakeRuss/witch-trials). Over the course of 550 years, the trials accused more than 43,000 people and led to 16,000 deaths. __Related__: [Leeson and Russ’s academic paper analyzing the data](https://www.peterleeson.com/Witch_Trials.pdf) (PDF). __Previously__: [The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft](https://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Research/witches/) ([DIP 2016.01.27](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-01-27-edition)).
