*Electoral attitudes, fishing activity, Bundestag writings, innovation licensing, and chess puzzles.*


__Electoral attitudes.__ The [Comparative National Elections Project](https://u.osu.edu/cnep/) “is a partnership among scholars who have conducted election surveys on five continents,” with a focus on understanding the factors that shape voters’ decisions. The project’s [publicly-available datasets](https://u.osu.edu/cnep/surveys/surveys-through-2012/) include 48 of the surveys, which use a combination of country-specific questions and [shared questionnaire](https://u.osu.edu/cnep/common-core-questionnaire/) — asking about political news consumption, attitudes towards democracy, interpersonal communications, and other topics. __Related__: The [Comparative Study of Electoral Systems](https://cses.org/), a similar collaboration with “a special emphasis on voting and turnout.” [h/t [Erik Gahner Larsen](https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData/commit/26ff4d1932024d71b29a1195597d5e5a64367cca)]


__Fishing activity.__ [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/) — initially organized as [a collaboration](https://globalfishingwatch.org/about-us/) between conservationists and Google — uses satellite imagery, ship signals, and other sources “to visualise, track and share data about global fishing activity in near real-time and for free.” The project’s [public datasets](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/) (free registration required) examine various aspects of the industry, including the [geography of “fishing effort”](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/fishing-effort/) (2012–16) and [transshipment between vessels](https://globalfishingwatch.org/transshipment-success/report-first-global-view-transshipment-sea/). __As seen in__: “[Why the U.K. and EU Are Fighting Over Fish](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-brexit-eu-fisheries/)” (Bloomberg).

__Bundestag writings.__ Political scientists [Corinna Kroeber](https://corinna-kroeber.jimdofree.com/) and [Tobias Remschel](https://twitter.com/tremsch) have [compiled](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/government-and-opposition/article/every-single-word-a-new-data-set-including-all-parliamentary-materials-published-in-germany/34D424C406687F7446C6F32980A4FE84) a [dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/7EJ1KI) of “all written communication published by the German Bundestag between 1949 and 2017,” unifying [datasets released by Germany’s parliament](https://www.bundestag.de/services/opendata) “in a manner easily accessible to researchers applying text analysis.” For each of the 131,835 reports, requests, bills, and other documents, the dataset provides the full text, date, author information, and more. __Previously__: [Six million parliamentary speeches from nine countries](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/L4OAKN) ([DIP 2020.04.29](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-04-29-edition).


__Innovation licensing.__ Government agencies often commercialize their innovations through “[technology transfer](https://federallabs.org/learning-center/what-is-t2)” programs, which strike collaboration and licensing agreements with outside parties. NASA provides a [technology transfer API](https://technology.nasa.gov/api/) for accessing data about its patent portfolio and software catalog; the National Institutes of Health offers a [similar API](https://www.ott.nih.gov/nih-ott-api) for querying its licensing opportunities.

__Chess puzzles.__ [Lichess](https://lichess.org/about) is a free, open-source, donation-supported chess server. Its team publishes a [database of the rated matches](https://database.lichess.org/) played on its platform (more than 1.7 billion so far, since 2013), which it recently used [to revamp](https://lichess.org/blog/X-S6gRUAAGjNX4ki/new-puzzles-are-here) its [dataset of original chess puzzles](https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles). __Previously__: [Chess games from high-level players and tournaments](http://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html) ([DIP 2016.02.17](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-02-17-edition)).
