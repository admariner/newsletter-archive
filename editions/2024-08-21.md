*H-1B lotteries, multinational corporations, California residential water supply, UK grantmakers, and Olympic medalists.*


*üëã Data Is Plural will be taking a short break, returning to your inbox in September.*


__H-1B lotteries.__ A [recent Bloomberg News investigation](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-staffing-firms-game-h1b-visa-lottery-system/) into the US government‚Äôs annual H-1B lottery, a key step in allocating the country‚Äôs skilled-worker visas, finds that ‚Äúthousands of companies got an unfair advantage by helping themselves to extra lottery tickets.‚Äù To reach those conclusions, the team ‚Äúobtained data on all H-1B lottery registrations, selections, and petitions for fiscal years 2021 through 2024 after bringing a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security under the Freedom of Information Act.‚Äù They‚Äôve [shared the records](https://github.com/BloombergGraphics/2024-h1b-immigration-data), which indicate each registration‚Äôs employer, as well as the proposed beneficiary‚Äôs gender, nationality, and birth year. For registrations that led to visa petitions, the data include additional details, such as the worksite, salary, job title, and beneficiary‚Äôs field of study.

__Multinational corporations.__ The [Multinational Enterprise Information Platform](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/dashboards/oecd-unsd-multinational-enterprise-information-platform.html), a [collaboration](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/business-stat/mne-platform/) between the [OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD) and the [UN Statistics Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Statistics_Division), provides [publicly sourced](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/the-oecd-unsd-multinational-enterprise-information-platform_b7d90a06-en.html) data on the 500 multinational corporations with the largest [market capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization). Its ‚ÄúGlobal Register‚Äù dataset examines the companies‚Äô structure, listing each subsidiary‚Äôs name, parent company, address, alternative names, and various unique identifiers. The ‚ÄúDigital Register‚Äù dataset lists all known web domains controlled by each company and assessments of those domains‚Äô popularity. The platform‚Äôs ‚ÄúMedia Monitor‚Äù feature, although not downloadable, links to news articles and other webpages mentioning the companies.

__California residential water supply.__ [Marie-Philine Gross et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03474-y)‚Äôs [dataset of residential water demand and supply in California](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/4ec7019fe63944bf87d40d2cdfa0d686/) includes the monthly volumes of water produced/sold by 404 of the state‚Äôs water suppliers, covering 2013‚Äì2021. The researchers extracted, standardized, and cleaned the data from the state‚Äôs [mandatory annual reports](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/ear.html), which collect thousands of data points from each supplier. They also added contextual information, such as climatic data (monthly local precipitation, temperature, and [drought severity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_drought_index)) and each supplier‚Äôs [hydrologic region](https://cww.water.ca.gov/regionscale).


__UK grantmakers.__ The [UK Grantmaking initiative](https://www.ukgrantmaking.org/) ‚Äúis a unique cross-sector collaboration between‚Äù [several major organizations in the field](https://www.ukgrantmaking.org/partners/). Their [downloadable dataset](https://www.ukgrantmaking.org/report/2024/methodology-data/#Full%20data) provides information about 12,000+ trusts, foundations, charities, and other grantmakers for financial year 2022-23, [based on records](https://www.ukgrantmaking.org/report/2024-06/methodology-data/) from government regulators. The dataset lists each organization‚Äôs name, government-assigned ID, location, category, registration date, income, spending totals, net assets, and more. __Previously__: [UK grants](https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/datasets/) via [360Giving](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/) ([DIP 2018.12.05](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-12-05-edition/)).

__Olympic medalists.__ The [European Data Journalism Network](https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/)‚Äôs [Giorgio Comai](https://giorgiocomai.eu/) has used Wikipedia and Wikidata to create a [series of datasets](https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/) listing the name, birth date, sex, and birthplace of Summer Olympic medalists. Comai has [mapped](https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/2024/medalists_map.html) the birthplace coordinates and, for Europe-born medalists, linked them to their [NUTS regions](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/statistical-units/territorial-units-statistics). The project focuses on the [2024](https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/2024/) and [2020](https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/2020/) Summer Olympics but also provides provisional data for other recent iterations.
