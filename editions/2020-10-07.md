Data Is Plural — 2020.10.07 edition
===================================

*Polling places, Xinjiang internment camps, historical newspaper imagery, a millennium of UK macroeconomic data, and a lifetime of first kisses.*


__Polling places.__ As part of [a new investigative series](https://publicintegrity.org/topics/politics/elections/ballotboxbarriers/), the [Center for Public Integrity](https://publicintegrity.org/) and [Stateline](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline) have published a [dataset of polling places](https://github.com/PublicI/us-polling-places) during the 2012–18 US general elections for 30 states (and plan to add more states “in the coming weeks”). To assemble the dataset, [reporters filed 1,200 records requests](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/ballotboxbarriers/data-release-sheds-light-on-past-polling-place-changes), and then converted the disparate files they received into standardized CSVs listing each polling place’s county, precinct, name, and address.


__Xinjiang internment camps.__ In August, BuzzFeed News published a [two-part investigation](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/china-new-internment-camps-xinjiang-uighurs-muslims) into China’s “vast new infrastructure” for imprisoning Muslim minorities in its Xinjiang region. The reporters used a novel methodology to of hundreds of detention facilities: [examining the gaps in Baidu Maps’ satellite imagery](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alison_killing/satellite-images-investigation-xinjiang-detention-camps). Last month, they published [a dataset](https://github.com/critocrito/xinjiang-camps-data) of those facilities’ coordinates and statuses. The [Australian Strategic Policy Institute](https://www.aspi.org.au/) has also [launched](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/24/china-has-built-380-internment-camps-in-xinjiang-study-finds) its [Xinjiang Data Project](https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/), [identifying](https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/data/?tab=datasets) [more than 380 detention facilities](https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/explainers/exploring-xinjiangs-detention-facilities/) as well as [the destruction of religious/cultural sites in the region](https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/explainers/cultural-erasure/). The project — which builds on previous research [by the institute](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/mapping-xinjiangs-re-education-camps), BuzzFeed News, and others — classifies the detention sites into four tiers, from “low-security re-education facilities” to “suspected maximum-security prisons.” [h/t [William Yang](https://twitter.com/WilliamYang120/status/1308950380219252736)]


__Historical newspaper imagery.__ The Library of Congress’ [Newspaper Navigator dataset](https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/) extracts “visual content” from more than 16 million pages of newspapers from 1789 to 1963, drawn from the library’s [Chronicling America project](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/) ([DIP 2017.08.16](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-08-16-edition)). To compile the dataset, its creators [used machine learning](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/newspaper-navigator) to detect seven types of visuals: photos, illustrations, maps, comics, editorial cartoons, headlines, and ads. They also built [an interactive search tool](https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/search). [h/t [Jessamyn West](https://www.metafilter.com/188743/This-is-the-largest-dataset-of-its-kind-ever-produced)]


__Even older UK economic figures.__ The Bank of England has considerably expanded its [longitudinal dataset on the UK’s economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/research-datasets) ([DIP 2017.01.25](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-01-25-edition)), renaming it “a millennium of macroeconomic data.” A few indicators (such as GDP per capita) now stretch back to 1086, thanks to the [Domesday Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book), while several others (such as consumer price inflation) now extend to the 13th century.

__A lifetime of first kisses.__ [The Kiss List](http://beebe-west.com/viz/kiss-list/) explores artist [Galen Beebe](https://www.galenbeebe.com/)’s 48 first kisses. Reconstructed from “memories and journals,” and developed with her partner [John West](http://beebe-west.com/john/), the [dataset](https://github.com/jswest/kiss-list-refresh/blob/master/public/data.json.js) and visualization present “a set of facts that show who, what, where, when, and why I kissed how I did.”
