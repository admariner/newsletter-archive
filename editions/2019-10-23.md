Data Is Plural — 2019.10.23 edition
===================================

*Autocracies, ECB speeches, biomedical citations, adoptable dogs, and data-visualization professionals.*

&nbsp;

**Autocracies.** The Autocratic Ruling Parties Dataset [bills itself](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022002719876000) as “the first comprehensive data set on the founding origins, modes of gaining and losing power, ruling tenures, and other characteristics of autocratic ruling parties.” [The dataset](https://sites.google.com/site/mkmtwo/data), created by political science professor [Michael K. Miller](https://sites.google.com/site/mkmtwo/home), covers nearly 500 parties in more than 150 countries between 1940 and 2015.

**Euro-bank speeches.** European Central Bank has begun publishing a spreadsheet of [all executive board members’ speeches](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/html/downloads.en.html) since the late 1990s. The dataset contains each speech’s date, speaker(s), title, subtitle, and text; the ECB says it will be updated every two months.

&nbsp;

**Biomedical citations.** The National Institutes of Health’s new [Open Citation Collection](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000385) brings together 420 million academic citations in biomedical literature. The data — the most comprehensive available for biomedicine — now underpins the NIH’s [iCite platform](https://icite.od.nih.gov/), where you can explore citation statistics online. The citations are also available [as a bulk download](https://doi.org/10.35092/yhjc.c.4586573) and [via an API](https://icite.od.nih.gov/api).

&nbsp;

**Adoptable dogs.** [The Pudding’s Amber Thomas](https://pudding.cool/author/amber-thomas/) used [PetFinder’s API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs) to collect [detailed data on all adoptable dogs](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/dog-shelters) at shelters and rescue organizations on a single day in September. **Related:** [Thomas's story for The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/2019/10/shelters/), which uses the data to examine state-to-state relocations.

&nbsp;

**Charts and minds.** The [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/) has published [the results](https://github.com/data-visualization-society/data_visualization_survey) of its [annual community survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-CMHrt1gYOxO9Tdk6cjyLIpJnAJMDjS94OBDHi6YU2g3sBA/viewform), which received 1,359 responses from data visualization practitioners. The public data contains answers to 50 questions on topics such as compensation, tools, community, and more. [h/t [Amy Cesal](https://www.amycesal.com/)]
