<p><strong>State abortion laws.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.guttmacher.org/about">Guttmacher Institute</a>, a
“research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and
reproductive health and rights,” maintains a <a
href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/overview-abortion-laws">table
summarizing each US state’s abortion laws</a>. It examines key aspects
of the legal landscape — such as gestational age limits, mandated
counseling, and whether an abortion must be performed by a licensed
physician — and links to topic-specific tables with <a
href="https://www.guttmacher.org/united-states/abortion/state-policies-abortion">additional
detail</a>. A <a
href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe">separate
table</a> categorizes, as of June 1, the policy implications in each
state of overturning <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. <strong>Previously</strong>:

<p><strong>Automated driving crashes.</strong> Last June, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a
href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting">issued
a directive</a> requiring manufacturers and fleet operators to report
certain crashes involving either <a

driver assistance</a> or higher-level “automated driving systems.”
Earlier this month, the agency <a
href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/initial-data-release-advanced-vehicle-technologies">published
its first release</a> of <a
href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting">crash
report data</a>, which it says “will be updated on a monthly basis.” The
files describe each report and include information about the car,
location, circumstances, and injury level. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Bay Area rents.</strong> In 2018, economist <a

href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> to <a
href="https://www.katepennington.org/clmethod">collect data</a> on two
decades of Craiglist posts advertising housing in the San Francisco Bay
Area. The <a href="https://www.katepennington.org/data">results span
200,000+ listings between 2000 and 2018</a>, from which Pennington
extracted each post’s date, price, bedroom count, location, and more.

<p><strong>Monkeypox cases.</strong> <a
href="https://global.health/">Global.health</a>, a <a

during the COVID-19 pandemic, has compiled a <a

interest rates</a>, which central banks adjust to influence inflation
and other aspects of the economy. The dataset, which includes both
official policy rates and analogous precursors, covers three dozen
countries plus the European Central Bank. The records span decades,
going as far back as 1946 for Denmark, India, Japan, Sweden,
Switzerland, and the UK; 1954 for the US; 1960 for Canada; and 1976 for
Australia.</p>

families.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Consumer prices.</strong> The US Bureau of Labor Statistics’
widely-cited <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/">Consumer Price Index</a>
measures “the average change over time in the prices paid by urban
consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.” In
addition to overall averages, the index provides <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm">decades of detailed data</a> on
monthly price changes for <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/additional-resources/index-publication-level.htm">hundreds
of sub-baskets</a>, ranging from broad groupings (e.g., apparel,
housing, education) to narrower categories (e.g., frozen vegetables,
window coverings, veterinarian services). [h/t <a
href="https://journaliststoolbox.substack.com/p/journalists-toolbox-business-part-ca8">Mike
Reilley</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Incarceration and redistricting.</strong> The US Census
counts prisoners as residing where they are incarcerated. In 2010,
however, <a
href="https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A9710-D.html">New York
passed a law</a> requiring the state to adjust these figures for
redistricting purposes, reassigning people in state and federal prisons
to their pre-incarceration addresses. Those adjusted counts, down to the
Census block level, are available for <a
href="https://latfor.state.ny.us/data/?sec=2010amendpop">2010</a> and <a
href="https://latfor.state.ny.us/data/?sec=2020amendpop">2020</a>. A <a
href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/ny/2020/report.html">new
report</a> from the <a
href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/about.html">Prison Policy
Initiative</a> and <a href="https://vocal-ny.org/about-us/">VOCAL-NY</a>
cross-references the 2020 data with the original Census numbers to

<a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/ny/2020/zipcode.html">ZIP

reports</a> for other states that have <a

comparable reforms</a>. [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Drug combinations.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01360-z">Guy Shtar et
al.</a>’s <a
href="https://icc.ise.bgu.ac.il/medical_ai/CDCDB/">Continuous Drug
Combination Database</a> identifies 17,000+ unique medical drug
combinations that have generated clinical interest, “curated
automatically” from <a

2017.03.08</a>), and international patent records. The automated
approach allows the database to be “continuously updated,” with new
versions published weekly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Airplane laser incidents.</strong> “Aiming a laser at an
aircraft is a serious safety risk and violates federal law,” <a
href="https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers">according</a> to the
Federal Aviation Administration, which encourages flight staff and the
public <a
href="https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/safety/report/laserinfo/">to submit
reports of such incidents</a>. The agency publishes <a
href="https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers/laws">annual
spreadsheets</a> of each reported incident since 2010, listing the date
and time, flight number, aircraft model, altitude, local airport, laser
color, and an injury indicator.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>European royal families.</strong> In “<a
href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20180521">A Network
of Thrones</a>,” economists <a href="https://www.sethgbenzell.com/">Seth

of all Democratic and Republican primary election results</a> for the US
House of Representatives between 1956 and 2010. It indicates each
election’s year, state, redistricting status, primary system (open,
closed, semi-open, multiparty), and more. The dataset also lists each
candidate’s name, gender, prior office, and votes received. In 2020, <a
href="https://www.michaelgmiller.com/">Michael G. Miller</a> and <a
href="https://twitter.com/nickicamberg">Nicki Camberg</a> published a <a

1,000+ protesters, opposition leaders, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_national_security_law">national
security law</a> defendants incarcerated since the city’s pro-democracy
mass protests in mid-2019. It lists each defendant’s age, arrest date,
arrest location, conviction date, convicted offenses, sentencing date,
sentence length, and other details. An <a

<p><strong>Supercomputers.</strong> Since 1993, a <a
href="https://www.top500.org/project/authors/">team of researchers</a>
has regularly assessed the most powerful computers in the world. The
resulting <a href="https://www.top500.org/">TOP500 lists</a> are
published twice a year, in June and November, using a <a
href="https://www.top500.org/project/linpack/">performance benchmark
developed by team member Jack Dongarra</a>, who <a
href="https://www.acm.org/media-center/2022/march/turing-award-2021">became
a Turing Award laureate this year</a>. Downloadable versions indicate
each supercomputer’s name, rank, location, manufacturer, year built,
power consumption, technical specifications, and more. <strong>As seen
in</strong>: “<a

those funded by the Department of Transportation and those participating
in a <a

<p><strong>Religion and government.</strong> To compile the <a

Religious Preference dataset</a>, researchers scrutinized primary
documents and secondary sources “for information on the existence,
origination, change, or discontinuation of a law or policy directed
toward” any of 30 religious denominations in 200+ countries. Then they
<a
href="https://www.thearda.com/archive/files/codebooks/origCB/GRP%202.0%20Codebook.pdf">assessed</a>
the degree to which those policies reflected institutional favor or
disfavor across 28 variables, themselves grouped into “five broad
components of state-religion”: <a

database</a> of 1,000+ officials elected since the 1970s “who publicly
identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, transgender, non-binary,
gender-non-conforming, queer or intersex.” The project focuses on
candidates elected to national, state, and mayoral offices. Entries
indicate each official’s name, country, party affiliation, level of
government, position held, year first elected, sexual and gender
identity, whether they were out when first elected, the year they came
out, and more. [h/t <a

contains all tornado reports for the contiguous US from 1950 to 2020,
plus major hail storms and “damaging wind” events since 1955. It lists
each incident’s date, starting and ending locations, intensity, injury

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Earmarks, intermediate care facilities, more county-level
mortality data, alpine snow, and the meta-Dataverse.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Earmarks.</strong> The US government’s <a
href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2471">spending
bill for FY 2022</a>, enacted last month, <a
href="https://www.axios.com/congressional-earmarks-new-constraints-44b0551d-bdfc-4e1e-b465-e1d2962c90b7.html">heralded
the return</a> of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earmark_(politics)">earmarks</a>,
which were banned for a decade. This time around, Congress <a
href="https://appropriations.house.gov/transparency/fiscal-year-2022">is
publishing a set of documents</a> that describe legislators’ specific
funding requests — but <a
href="https://twitter.com/danielschuman/status/1511322851932000260">as
sideways PDFs instead of structured data</a>. So the Bipartisan Policy
Center has <a
href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/congressionally-directed-spending-fy2022-dataset/">converted
the PDFs into a spreadsheet</a> listing the 4,975 approved earmarks
within them. Bloomberg Government has also <a
href="https://about.bgov.com/news/colleges-cops-airports-among-earmark-winners-in-2022-funding/">compiled
and shared</a> a similar spreadsheet. Both files list each earmarked
project’s name, recipient, state, and price tag, as well as the
legislator(s) who made the request and the subcommittee that approved
it; BPC’s file additionally includes the location, agency,
agency-account, and legislators’ <a

IDs</a>. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Intermediate care facilities.</strong> In the US, <a
href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certification/CertificationandComplianc/ICFIID">intermediate
care facilities</a> provide residential, long-term care to people whose
intellectual or developmental disabilities require active treatment and
continuous supervision. On Monday, colleagues at BuzzFeed News published
an <a
href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kendalltaggart/kkr-brightspring-disability-private-equity-abuse">investigation
into one of the largest ICF owners</a>, supplemented by an <a
href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2022-04-icf-analysis">analysis of
inspection data</a> gathered through the Centers for Medicare &amp;
Medicaid Services’ <a href="https://qcor.cms.gov/">QCOR portal</a>.
(Disclosure: I helped to write an initial version of the data-collection
code.) The records, <a
href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2022-04-icf-analysis/tree/main/data/qcor">available
in bulk</a> for the first time, <a
href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2022-04-icf-analysis#survey-data">enumerate</a>
surveys conducted between 2010 and 2021, the facilities examined, and
the types of deficiencies inspectors found. [h/t <a

<p><strong>More county-level, COVID-related mortality data.</strong> The
CDC provides <a

county-level mortality data for 2018 to the near-present</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-12-15-edition/">DIP

<p><strong>Alpine snow.</strong> <a

al. (2021)</a> compiled a <a
href="https://zenodo.org/record/5109574">dataset of daily snowfall and
snow depths</a> at 2,000+ measurement stations in the European Alps,
spanning the years 1970 to 2019. They gathered records from open data
portals and through requests to authorities in five countries,
standardized them into a consistent format, and filled in gaps where
possible. [h/t <a
