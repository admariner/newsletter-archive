<p> </p>
<p><strong>Citizenship laws.</strong> The <a href="https://globalcit.eu/">Global Citizenship Observatory</a>’s new <a href="https://globalcit.eu/databases/globalcit-citizenship-law-dataset/">Citizenship Law Dataset</a> “outlines, in a systematic way, 28 ways in which citizenship can be acquired and 15 ways in which citizenship can be lost.” <a href="https://twitter.com/GlobalCIT_EUI/status/1466362913019596803">Launched last week</a> and <a href="https://globalcit.eu/a-new-globalcit-citizenship-law-dataset-what-why-and-how/">building on the observatory’s previous work</a>, it covers the laws in effect in 190 countries in January 2020. For each mode of acquisition or loss in each jurisdiction, the dataset points to the legal citations, specifies the type of procedure (discretionary, automatic, etc.), and describes the relevant conditions (for instance, wedlock requirements for citizenship-by-descent). <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://macimide.maastrichtuniversity.nl/dual-cit-database/">Dual citizenship policies</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-01-09-edition/">DIP 2019.01.09</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Overturned Supreme Court decisions.</strong> The Library of Congress’s <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/">Constitution Annotated</a> project is a “comprehensive, government-sanctioned record of the interpretations of the Constitution,” intended for a wide audience and <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/about/constitution-annotated/">in publication for more than 100 years</a>. Its resources include a table of <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/decisions-overruled/">Supreme Court Decisions overruled by subsequent decisions</a>, with the names and years of the initial and overruling cases, and another of <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/unconstitutional-laws/">laws held unconstitutional</a>. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/appx-1/ALDE_00000679/">The methodologies for both tables</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://qz.com/2098152/how-often-are-supreme-court-decisions-overturned/">How often are Supreme Court decisions overturned?</a>” (Quartz).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Birds at the feeder.</strong> <a href="https://feederwatch.org/">Project FeederWatch</a> is a “November-April survey of birds that visit backyards, nature centers, community areas, and other locales in North America.” Tens of thousands of <a href="https://feederwatch.org/pfw/participants">volunteers</a> <a href="https://feederwatch.org/about/detailed-instructions/">record</a> the number and species of birds at each feeder, plus information about the surrounding environment. The results can be <a href="https://feederwatch.org/explore/">explored online</a> and <a href="https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/">downloaded in bulk</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/11/28/bird-feeder-pecking-order/">Which birds are the biggest jerks at the feeder?</a>” (Washington Post), which uses additional behavioral data <a href="https://feederwatch.org/about/detailed-instructions/#record-behavior-interactions">collected</a> by the volunteers; and a <a href="https://twitter.com/EliotITMiller/status/1465126217133219841">related Twitter thread</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pandemic-era alcohol policies.</strong> The US <a href="https://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov/about-apis">Alcohol Policy Information System</a> has <a href="https://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov/resource/covid-19/98">categorized the alcohol-related regulations</a> that each state (and DC) has enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how they’ve changed over time. The dataset covers January 2020 to mid-September 2021; it examines restrictions on bar and restaurant capacity, serving alcohol without food, alcohol delivery, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A map of our moon.</strong> A USGS <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/astrogeology-science-center/science/mrctr-gis-lab?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects">astrogeology lab</a> has built a <a href="https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Moon/Geology/Unified_Geologic_Map_of_the_Moon_GIS_v2">1:5,000,000-scale map of Earth’s moon</a>, the “chief purpose” of which is “to summarize the current state of lunar geologic knowledge.” It marks thousands of geologic boundaries, plus “surface features” such as crater rims, “fissures, grabens, scarps, mare wrinkle ridges” and more.

<p><strong>Banking-crisis interventions.</strong> Economists <a href="https://faculty.som.yale.edu/andrewmetrick/">Andrew Metrick</a> and <a href="https://www.pfschmelzing.me/">Paul Schmelzing</a> have <a href="https://som.yale.edu/faculty-research-centers/centers-initiatives/program-on-financial-stability/metrick-schmelzing-paper-and-database">compiled a database</a> of 800+ banking crises spanning the years 1257 to 2019, plus 1,800+ government attempts to mitigate them. For each crisis, the database provides the starting year, relevant country or region, a brief description, and more. It also describes the interventions, lists their dates, classifies them into 20 categories (asset guarantees, market liquidity assistance, etc.), and links them to sources and prior literature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Europe’s primary forests.</strong> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00988-7">Francesco Maria Sabatini et al.</a> have combined information from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00988-7/tables/4">dozens of sources</a> to develop “the most comprehensive dataset” of Europe’s “primary forests” — those “where the signs of human impacts, if any, are strongly blurred due to decades without forest management.” The <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/European_Primary_Forest_Database/13194095/2">dataset</a>, which includes 18,411 patches across 33 countries, describes their names, locations, level of “naturalness,” dominant tree species, and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2016123">EU-Forest</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-01-25-edition/">DIP 2017.01.25</a>).</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Carbon credits, foodborne pathogens, violence against environmental defenders, mineral production, and Werner’s Nomenclature of Colours.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Carbon credits.</strong> The <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/faculty-and-impact/centers/cepp/projects/berkeley-carbon-trading-project/offsets-database">Voluntary Registry Offsets Database</a>, a collaboration between the <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/faculty-and-impact/centers/cepp/projects/berkeley-carbon-trading-project">Berkeley Carbon Trading Project</a> and <a href="https://carbon-direct.com/">Carbon Direct</a>, “contains all carbon offset projects, credit issuances, and credit retirements listed globally by four major voluntary offset project registries,” accounting for “almost all of the world’s voluntary market offsets.” Updated in September with data through early May 2021, the database covers 5,000+ projects and 1.2 billion credits issued. Each credit purportedly offsets a metric tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but the Berkeley team is skeptical: “Research performed by us and others has found that many, if not most, offset credits traded on the market today do not represent real emissions reductions.” <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/map_data">The World Bank’s database of carbon pricing initiatives</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Violence against environmental defenders.</strong> <a href="https://tierraderesistentes.com/en/">Tierra de Resistentes</a> is a “crossborder journalistic effort to investigate episodes of violence against leaders and communities in Latin America who have devoted their lives to defending the environment.” The <a href="https://tierraderesistentes.com/es/datos/">collaboration’s database</a> details 2,400+ such attacks, mostly focusing on the years 2009–2019. For each attack, it provides information about the person, organization, or community attacked, the type of violence, the resource defended, case status, and more.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Toxic pollution, campsite reservations, time zones, NFTs, and damn fine coffees.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Toxic pollution.</strong> Last week, ProPublica published what it’s calling “<a href="https://projects.propublica.org/toxmap/">the most detailed map of cancer-causing industrial air pollution in the U.S.</a>,” along with an <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/toxmap-poison-in-the-air">investigation</a> based on the map’s revelations. In a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-created-the-most-detailed-map-ever-of-cancer-causing-industrial-air-pollution">methodology article</a>, reporters explain how they analyzed billions of rows of data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/rsei">Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators model</a>, which “takes a variety of inputs, including emissions data, weather modeling, and facility specific information, and puts out estimated concentrations of toxic chemicals in the air around industrial facilities.” The EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/rsei/ways-get-rsei-results">publishes the model’s output</a> as bulk downloads, in an online dashboard, and in other formats. <strong>Related</strong>: The model incorporates information from the EPA’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program">Toxics Release Inventory</a>, which <a href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/find-understand-and-use-tri">publishes</a> self-reported emissions data from <a href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-threshold-screening-tool">certain mandated industrial facilities</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Campsite reservations.</strong> The US government’s <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/">Recreation Information Database</a> “represents an authoritative source of information and services for millions of visitors to federal lands, historic sites, museums, and other attractions/resources.” It provides <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/download">bulk data</a> and <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/docs">an API</a> describing recreational areas, campgrounds, campsites, permit entrances, scheduled tours, and more.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Judicial financial disclosures.</strong> US federal judges must file annual reports disclosing their investments, external income, and other potential conflicts of interest. The filings are technically available to the public, <a href="https://free.law/2021/09/28/announcing-federal-financial-disclosures">but onerous to access</a>. So the <a href="https://free.law/">Free Law Project</a> undertook an effort to obtain and <a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/disclosure-extractor">parse</a> <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/coverage/financial-disclosures/">as many of them as possible</a>, ultimately <a href="https://free.law/2021/10/15/financial-disclosures-now-available-to-all-on-courtlistener">creating a database</a> of 250,000+ pages of disclosures, which you can <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/financial-disclosures/">search online</a> or <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/#financialdisclosure-endpoint">via an API</a>, including “complete coverage of every judge, justice, and magistrate between 2011 and 2018.” <strong>Read more</strong>: “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/131-federal-judges-broke-the-law-by-hearing-cases-where-they-had-a-financial-interest-11632834421">131 Federal Judges Broke the Law by Hearing Cases Where They Had a Financial Interest</a>,” the first article in <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Awsj.com+%22Hidden+Interests%22&amp;t=h_&amp;iar=news&amp;ia=news">an ongoing series by the WSJ</a>, which had early access to the database.

<p><strong>Wildlife death and illness reports.</strong> <a href="https://whispers.usgs.gov/home">WHISPers</a>, hosted by the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, is a “repository for sharing basic information about historic and ongoing wildlife mortality (death) and/or morbidity (illness) events,” with contributions from “hundreds of natural resource managers and stakeholders across the U.S. and beyond.” Wisconsin officials, for instance, <a href="https://whispers.usgs.gov/event/201296">reported that a bald eagle died of lead poisoning in Adams County this April</a>. You can search WHISPers by date range, county, species, diagnosis, and more — up to 500 events at a time, exportable as CSV files.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Abortion policies, hourly weather, deployment votes, mask diplomacy, and bird food.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Abortion policies.</strong> The World Health Organization’s <a href="https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/">Global Abortion Policies Database</a> is “designed to strengthen global efforts to eliminate unsafe abortion by producing an interactive open-access database and repository of current abortion laws, policies, and national standards and guidelines.” The project uses an <a href="https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/data/questionnaire.pdf">extensive questionnaire</a> to categorize dozens of regulatory factors for each country; the findings can be <a href="https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/countries/">queried</a> online, or <a href="https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/data/survey.xlsx">downloaded as a spreadsheet</a>. The Center for Reproductive Rights’ <a href="https://maps.reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws">World Abortion Laws Map</a> groups countries into five categories of restrictiveness, and also indicates the types of laws in effect. The map’s data is <a href="https://maps.reproductiverights.org/ajax/wal-map">available as a JSON file</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2021/us-abortion-laws-worldwide/">How abortion laws in the U.S. compare to those in other countries</a>” (Washington Post).

<p><strong>Hourly weather.</strong> NOAA’s <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database">Integrated Surface Database</a>, launched two decades ago, combines point-in-time weather observations from 100+ sources, collected at 35,000+ stations around the world, 14,000+ of which are still active. The measurements can include “wind speed and direction, wind gust, temperature, dew point, cloud data, sea level pressure, altimeter setting, station pressure, present weather, visibility, precipitation amounts for various time periods, snow depth” and more. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/noaa-weather-data-by-major-u-s-city">An Observable notebook for previewing and downloading data from ISDLite</a>, NOAA’s simpler version of the larger database.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Deployment votes.</strong> The <a href="http://deploymentvotewatch.eu/">Parliamentary Deployment Votes Database</a> gathers information about national parliaments and legislatures voting on the deployment or withdrawal of military forces. It lists the date, name, and chamber of each vote; the mission name and area of deployment; the number of members voting in favor, against, and abstaining; and other details. The <a href="http://deploymentvotewatch.eu/?page_id=8">collaborative</a> project’s <a href="http://deploymentvotewatch.eu/?page_id=2">latest release</a> includes 1,000+ votes in 21 countries from 1990 to 2019, plus 5,500+ counts disaggregated by political party.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>K-12 learning arrangements, rushing waters, voluntary union recognition, four decades of Spanish elections, and cryptic crossword clues.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>K-12 learning arrangements.</strong> The <a href="https://www.covidschooldatahub.com">COVID-19 School Data Hub</a>, which <a href="https://emilyoster.substack.com/p/special-edition-today-covid-19-school">launched last week</a>, is “a central database for educators, researchers, and policymakers to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic shaped students’ modes of learning in 2020-21.” The project’s team, led by economist <a href="https://emilyoster.net/">Emily Oster</a>, has gathered data on learning models (in-person, virtual, or hybrid) used by public schools and districts at various points in time, their masking policies, and reported COVID-19 cases. The datasets can be <a href="https://www.covidschooldatahub.com/for_researchers">downloaded in bulk</a> or <a href="https://www.covidschooldatahub.com/explore_by_state">by state</a>. The coverage and granularity vary by topic and state; the project’s <a href="https://www.covidschooldatahub.com/methods">documentation</a> describes the collection methods and availability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rushing waters.</strong> The US Geological Survey’s <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis">National Water Information System</a> provides data on the “occurrence, quantity, quality, distribution, and movement of surface and underground waters” around the country. The <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/sw">surface water measurements</a> — mainly <a href="https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/tutorials/surface-water-data/how-do-i-interpret-gage-height-and-streamflow-values">streamflow and gage height</a> — come from tens of thousands of monitoring sites. (<a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/07378000/#parameterCode=00065&amp;startDT=2021-08-26&amp;endDT=2021-09-21">Here’s a site near Baton Rouge</a> before and after <a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_c06a0dba-159b-11ec-9f44-7769e5bab072.html">hurricanes Ida and Nicholas</a>.) There’s an <a href="https://waterservices.usgs.gov/">API for accessing the records</a>, including <a href="https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/DV-Service.html">daily summaries</a> and <a href="https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Service.html">real-time measurements</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/nwlon.html">NOAA’s water-level data</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-03-23-edition/">DIP 2016.03.23</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Voluntary union recognition.</strong> Civic technologist <a href="https://twitter.com/forestgregg">Forest Gregg</a> has begun <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/voluntary-recognitions-january-1-june-30-2021-116304/">filing FOIA requests</a> to the National Labor Relations Board <a href="https://github.com/labordata/nlrb-voluntary-recognitions">to collect newly-available data</a> on employers’ voluntary recognition of employee unions, drawn from agency’s <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-195/5581_7-20.pdf">relevant notification form</a>. The <a href="https://flatgithub.com/labordata/nlrb-voluntary-recognitions/blob/main/voluntary_recognitions.csv?sort=Date%20VR%20Request%20Received%2Cdesc">records so far</a> include 70+ recognitions in late 2020 and early 2021, plus nearly 1,000 from a prior reporting program between 2007 and 2009; they list the employer, union, case number, relevant dates, and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/reports/graphs-data/recent-election-results">Union election results</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-05-05-edition/">DIP 2021.05.05</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Four decades of Spanish elections.</strong> The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00975-y">Spanish Electoral Archive</a>, published this summer, provides detailed results of all municipal, regional, general, and European Parliament elections in Spain since the country’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_transition_to_democracy">transition to democracy</a> in the late 1970s. The <a href="http://sea.uv.es/gipeyop/sea.html">project</a>’s <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/SEA">datasets</a> standardize records from various official sources that, in many cases, drill down to the level of individual ballot boxes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hidden clue here will be!</strong> Data scientist <a href="https://www.eigenfoo.xyz/">George Ho</a> has compiled a <a href="https://cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz/">dataset of 589,000+ clues</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword">cryptic crosswords</a>, “collected from various blogs and publicly available digital archives.” The collection, <a href="https://github.com/eigenfoo/cryptics/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">released</a> earlier this month, is available to download and also <a href="https://cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz/clues/clues">explore online</a>. (<a href="https://cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz/clues/clues?_sort=rowid&amp;clue__contains=%21&amp;answer__exact=CRYPTIC">For example</a>.) Its “<a href="https://cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz/datasheet">datasheet</a>” describes the motivation, collection process, composition, and more.</p>
