elections (1) more centralized and accessible, (2) easier to work with,
and (3) more versatile […].” It assigns each contributor a unique
identifier, geocodes their stated addresses, quantifies their
ideological orientation, and more. The raw data come from several
sources, including the <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/">Federal
Election Commission</a> and <a

“a novel deep learning pipeline that incorporates layout detection,
legibility classification, custom OCR, and the association of article
texts spanning multiple bounding boxes.” For each article, the dataset
provides the newspaper name, edition number, date of publication
(largely in the 1800s–1920s), page number, headline, byline, and article
text. <strong>Previously</strong>: The LOC’s <a

the density of annotations in the <a

<p><strong>Eponymic streets.</strong> <a

the <a href="https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/">European Data
Journalism Network</a>, “is a platform for discovering key facts about
diversity and representation in street names across Europe, and to spark
a debate about who is missing from our urban spaces.” The interactive

March, accompanied by <a

dataset</a>, which provides information for every street examined, plus
data for six more cities. Each row indicates a street’s country, city,
and name; whether it’s named after anyone; and, if so, the person’s
name, gender, and various attributes from <a

Dataset</a> “covers all ceasefires in civil conflict between 1989 and
2020, including multilateral, bilateral and unilateral arrangements,
ranging from verbal arrangements to detailed written agreements.” The
dataset’s 2,200+ ceasefires span 109 conflicts in 66 countries, largely
based on news articles discussing the agreements. A team of reviewers
manually coded each instance, indicating its type and stated purpose;
sides participating; dates declared, entered effect, and ended; and
more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a

insects, tree saplings, bacteria, and other living organisms. The

<p><strong>International cancer statistics.</strong> The World Health
Organization’s <a href="https://gco.iarc.fr/">Global Cancer

href="https://gco.iarc.fr/projects">interfaces</a> to a range of studies
and statistics. Its <a href="https://gco.iarc.fr/today/home">Cancer
Today</a> portal features tables, charts, and maps of “incidence,
mortality and prevalence for year 2020 in 185 countries or territories
for 36 cancer types by sex and age group.” Those figures come from the
<a
href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21660">latest
GLOBOCAN estimates</a>, calculated by the WHO’s <a
href="https://www.iarc.who.int/">International Agency for Research on
Cancer</a> based on data from national and regional registries.
<strong>Note</strong>: “Caution must be exercised when interpreting
these estimates, given the limited quality and coverage of cancer data
worldwide at present, particularly in low- and middle-income countries,”
<a href="https://gco.iarc.fr/today/about">the researchers warn</a>.

<p><strong>SSVF satisfaction surveys.</strong> The Veterans

href="https://www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf/index.html">Supportive Services
for Veteran Families</a> program aims to “to promote housing stability
among very low-income Veteran families who reside in or are
transitioning to permanent housing.” The VA outsources those services to
a network of 200+ selected nonprofits, which it grants hundreds of
millions of dollars per year. When a veteran exits a grantee’s program,
they’re invited to complete a satisfaction survey. The <a

Project</a> (which, disclosure, I run) <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/ssvf-satisfaction-surveys/">filed

<p><strong>Scotland’s Common Good.</strong> Scotland’s <a

<p><strong>Nursing home inspections.</strong> A couple of weeks ago,
ProPublica <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/article/here-whats-new-in-nursing-home-inspect-database">launched
a major update</a> to its <a
href="https://projects.propublica.org/nursing-homes/">Nursing Home
Inspect</a> database, originally published in 2012 (and briefly
mentioned in <a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-07-06-edition/">DIP
2016.07.06</a>). The new version “includes more data, new views that
summarize problems, and advanced search features.” As an <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-use-updated-nursing-home-inspect">accompanying
guide</a> explains, the database now “covers nearly 400,000 deficiencies
from over 90,000 reports at over 15,000 homes.” The project links to its
source data, including the federal government’s <a
href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py">list of
Medicare-certified nursing homes</a> and the date, regulation,
scope/severity, and narrative text of all deficiencies.
<strong>Tip</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Local ideology.</strong> “Little is known about the American

state legislative districts, and local municipalities,” <a

the Journal of Politics a decade ago</a>. To address the issue, the
researchers applied Bayesian statistical methods to large public-opinion
surveys to generate numeric “ideal point” (left-vs-right) estimates at
many geographic levels. Through their <a

Project</a>, they have since <a

white-tailed deer across Washington, D.C. and 26 states in the United
States between November 2021 and April 2022.” The researchers sequenced
the COVID-19 genomes from 391 of the samples that tested positive for
the virus, finding that the infections “originated from at least 109
independent spillovers from humans, which resulted in 39 cases of
subsequent local deer-to-deer transmission and three cases of potential
spillover from white-tailed deer back to humans.” The <a

to billions of dollars per year — to the federal government, local
governments, tribes, and individuals. Through its <a

country, receiving country, type of diplomatic title (e.g., ambassador,

prince/princess, baron/baroness, etc.), pronouns used when referring to
the diplomat, or the recognition of names as either female or male.” The

<p><strong>The latest White House visitors.</strong> In May 2021, the

releasing</a> its <a
href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/disclosures/visitor-logs/">logs of
visitors to the White House</a>. The records now include 500,000+
entries from January 2021 to March 2023, featuring 350,000+ distinct
names and indicating the visit’s timing, visitee, meeting location, and
more. <strong>Caveat</strong>: “However, a Bloomberg News analysis of
the data found duplications, anomalies and missing names,” <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-26/biden-re-opens-white-house-visitor-logs-but-some-names-are-missing">write

five visits from Nancy Pelosi when she was House Speaker, despite at
least 20 known instances when she was there.”

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rape kit backlogs.</strong> The actual number of unanalyzed
sexual assault kits in the United States is <a
href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/untested-evidence-sexual-assault-cases">unknown</a>.
But last year “at least 25,000 untested rape kits sat in law enforcement
agencies and crime labs across the country,” <a
href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-rape-kits-are-awaiting-testing-in-the-us-see-the-data-by-state/">according
to rape kit backlog data</a> compiled by USAFacts, <a
href="https://usafacts.org/articles/detailed-methodology-rape-kit-backlog-data/">based
on responses</a> by 30 states and DC to public records requests. <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethbkim/">Elizabeth “Betsy”
Kim</a>, who led the project, has published the <a
href="https://github.com/elizabethbkim/rape-kits-data">raw records the
agencies and labs provided</a>, as well as her correspondence with them.
The core data indicate the number of kits in each backlog each year
between 2018 and 2022; the backlog definition (in number of days) the
state used in the data they provided; and, of the kits received by crime
labs in 2022, how many were tested within 30 days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Global income deciles.</strong> <a
href="https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2023-137/">Kanishka B.
Narayan et al.</a> “present a consistent dataset of income distributions
across 190 countries from 1958 to 2015 measured in terms of net income.”
Where net income statistics were unavailable, the authors imputed the
deciles from consumption data or <a
href="https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/gender-statistics/series/SI.POV.GINI">the
country’s Gini coefficient</a>. Their paper also provides a comparison
of <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7093997">their dataset</a> to the

<p> </p>
<p><strong>US fire statistics.</strong> The US <a
href="https://www.nifc.gov/">National Interagency Fire Center</a> “is
home to the national fire management programs of each federal fire
agency, along with partners,” such as the National Weather Service. It
provides a <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Species introduced to the Antarctic.</strong> “From the
earliest expeditions to Antarctica and the Southern Ocean Islands,
humans have intentionally and accidentally introduced non-native species
to the region,” write <a

of “introduced and invasive alien species” documented in the region. The
dataset identifies 3,000+ location-species combinations, providing their
“establishment, eradication status, dates of introduction, habitat, and
evidence of impact,” plus reference citations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Swedish air traffic control.</strong> <a
href="https://liu.se/en/employee/jenni29">Jens Nilsson</a> and <a
href="https://liu.se/en/employee/jonun48">Jonas Unger</a>’s <a

people with mental health issues from prosecution if they cannot
understand the legal system and cannot aid in their own defense.” The
team has also published the <a

received from the state’s court administrators</a>, with information
about 697 cases that involved competency proceedings between 2018 to

<p><strong>Food defect thresholds.</strong> “How many rat hairs in your

Defect Levels Handbook</a>. That guide’s “action levels” table lists 180

or unavoidable defects in foods for human use that present no health
hazard.” Winchester has <a

<p><strong>Firearm suicide rates.</strong> A recent <a

(<a

in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine</a>) and <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QVYDUD">dataset</a>
by <a href="https://www.megankang.com/">Megan Kang</a> and <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-rasich-087b1a144/">Elizabeth
Rasich</a> “extends an existing proxy for household gun ownership rates
— the rate of firearm suicide divided by suicide (FSS) — from 1949 to
2020, including new coverage for the 1949 to 1972 period.” For each
state and year, the dataset provides the count and population-adjusted
rate of suicides, firearm suicides, homicides, and firearm homicides,
among other figures. The first 30 years of firearm suicide/homicide
counts had to be transcribed from scanned National Center for Health
Statistics reports; later figures come from the CDC’s <a

<p><strong>Ransomware negotiations.</strong> Negotiations between <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware">ransomware</a> victims
and their attackers “are usually not shared widely, limiting the
understanding of the process,” writes journalist <a
href="https://github.com/Casualtek">Valéry Marchive</a>, whose <a
href="https://github.com/Casualtek/Ransomchats">repository of chat
transcripts</a> “aims at changing that, in a respectful manner for the
victims of cyberattacks: chats are anonymized as long as the victim
hasn’t been publicly disclosed, either by the attackers or in the
media.” [h/t <a href="https://www.duncangeere.com/">Duncan
