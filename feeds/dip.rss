<p><strong>Government contracting data, cataloged.</strong> The
nonprofit <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/about/">Open
Contracting Partnership</a> has <a
href="https://www.open-contracting.org/2023/02/23/a-new-registry-for-open-contracting-data/">launched</a>
a <a href="https://data.open-contracting.org/en/">registry</a> of
government procurement datasets that use its <a
href="https://www.open-contracting.org/data-standard/">Open Contracting
Data Standard</a> (featured in <a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-02-26-edition/">DIP
2020.02.26</a>). The registry contains 100+ entries so far, across 50+
countries — from Argentina’s <a
href="https://data.open-contracting.org/en/publication/18">national
roads authority</a> and the <a
href="https://data.open-contracting.org/en/publication/17">city of
Buenos Aires</a> to Zambia’s <a
href="https://data.open-contracting.org/en/publication/3">Public
Procurement Authority</a>. You can <a
href="https://data.open-contracting.org/en/search/">filter the
listings</a> by dataset recency, update frequency, and the <a
href="https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/reference/#release-structure">data
types</a> included (parties, awards, documents, amendments, et cetera).

<p><strong>Debt-to-income ratios.</strong> The US Federal Reserve <a
href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/household_debt/">generates
quarterly statistics</a> estimating the median ratio of household debt
to income in each state, county, and metro area. The published maps and
datasets, which go back to 1999, don’t include precise figures, but
rather place each geographic unit into one of ten ranges. The income
calculations <a
href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/household-debt-to-income-ratios-in-the-enhanced-financial-accounts-20180109.html">come
from</a> the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while the debt estimates (which
do not include student loans) come from the <a
href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr479">New York
Fed Consumer Credit Panel</a>, “an anonymized 5 percent random sample of
Americans with credit files at the credit reporting bureau Equifax.”

<p><strong>Changes of address.</strong> In the “Frequently Requested
Records” section of its <a
href="https://about.usps.com/who/legal/foia/library.htm">online FOIA
library</a>, the US Postal Service provides datasets counting how many
individuals, families, and businesses have registered for the agency’s
change-of-address service, by month and ZIP code. The datasets tally the
moves originating from a given ZIP code separately from those destined
for it, although moves within the same ZIP code are counted on both
sides of the ledger. <strong>Related</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Decades of UK prices.</strong> In January 2023, the UK’s
Office for National Statistics collected 139,000+ price quotes from
thousands of stores and across hundreds of products, from “A4 PRINTER
PAPER (500 REAM)” to “YORKSHIRE PUDDING FROZEN”. The agency has
collected this kind of <a
href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceindicescpiandretailpricesindexrpiitemindicesandpricequotes">price-quote
data</a> for <a
href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/adhocs/007392consumerpriceinflationpricequotes1988to1996">decades</a>,
using it to calculate <a
href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices">inflation
and price indices</a>. Economist <a
href="https://richarddavies.io/about">Richard Davies</a> has <a
href="https://richarddavies.io/research/prices">aggregated the data
going back to 1988 and standardized it</a>, correcting misrecorded
prices, offsetting measurement changes, among other efforts described in
a <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Shows cut short.</strong> <a
href="https://www.isitcutshort.com/">IsItCutShort.com</a> provides a
searchable list of television shows that were canceled (e.g., <a
href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083437/">Knight Rider</a>), ended on
a cliffhanger (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141842/">The
Sopranos</a>), or both (<a
href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389371/">Rubicon</a>). The <a
href="https://github.com/xdpirate/isitcutshort.com">database</a>
provides each series’s title, cliffhanger and cancellation status, IMDB
identifier, and occasional extra notes. A handful of the 130+ entries
fit another category: shows that “ended without a cliffhanger, but more
show content exists outside the show itself.” [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Congressional votes and ideology.</strong> The <a
href="https://voteview.com/">Voteview</a> project “allows users to view
every congressional roll call vote in American history,” and places
those votes in the <a href="https://voteview.com/about">context of
ideology estimates along a liberal-to-conservative spectrum</a>. The
core estimates come from <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method)">DW-NOMINATE</a>,
a method developed by the project’s directors emeritus, <a
href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/83232/">Keith T. Poole and
Howard Rosenthal</a>. Voteview’s <a

estimates for every member</a> of the House and Senate since 1789, <a

<p><strong>EPA-regulated facilities.</strong> The US Environmental
Protection Agency’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/frs">Facility Registry
System</a> “provides Internet access to a single source of comprehensive
information about facilities, sites or places subject to environmental
regulations or of environmental interest.” It includes each entity’s
name, type, location, industry, regulatory programs, and more. That
information, which spans millions of facilities, is “subjected to
rigorous verification and data management quality assurance procedures.”
The records also provide facilities’ ID numbers from other EPA systems,
such as the agency’s <a

Management Program database</a> featured in <a

<p><strong>20th-century occupations.</strong> Between 1939 and 1991, the
US government published several iterations of the now-discontinued <a
href="https://www.oalj.dol.gov/PUBLIC/DOT/REFERENCES/DOTINTRO.HTM">Dictionary
of Occupational Titles</a>, a precursor to the <a

href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-09-27-edition/">DIP
2017.09.27</a>). The dictionaries included job descriptions,
classification codes, and cross-references, but are mostly available
only as scans. So <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07073">Shahad
Althobaiti et al.</a> organized the manual transcription of five major
editions into <a

<p><strong>Thump, thump, coconut.</strong> “Traditionally,” in the

manually,” <a

Anne Caladcad and Eduardo Piedad Jr. write</a>. “Traders often use their
fingernails, knuckles, or the blunt end of the knife to tap the coconuts
before assessing the sounds produced.” The authors <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168169919324767">and
their colleagues</a> have developed hardware and software to emulate
that process, and used it to collect <a

data</a> from 129 premature, mature, and overmature coconuts, each
mechanically knocked on each of its three ridges.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Facilities handling hazardous chemicals, Animal Welfare Act
inspections, daily European gas imports, unclaimed estates, and data
journalists.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Facilities handling hazardous chemicals.</strong> The US
Environmental Protection Agency’s <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/rmp/risk-management-program-rmp-rule-overview">Risk
Management Program rule</a> requires facilities that handle “extremely
hazardous substances” to tell the government, at least every five years,
about those substances, their safety plans, their recent accident
history, and more. Through a <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/epa-risk-management-program/">FOIA
request to the EPA</a>, the <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation
Project</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/about/">which, disclosure,
I run</a>) obtained a copy of the agency’s database of these filings
(minus some parts the government deems non-disclosable), containing
submissions by 21,000+ facilities from early 1999 to February 2022. You
can now <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/epa-risk-management-program-database/">access
that data</a>, in various formats, along with <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jrLXtv0knnACiPXJ1ZRFXR1GaPWCHJWWjin4rsthFbQ/edit">documentation
guiding you through it</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Animal Welfare Act inspections.</strong> The USDA’s <a
href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/">Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service</a> checks whether animal dealers, exhibitors,
research facilities, and transporters are complying with the care
standards set by the <a
href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalwelfare/awa/ct_awa_program_information">Animal
Welfare Act</a>. The agency provides <a
href="https://efile.aphis.usda.gov/PublicSearchTool/s/inspection-reports">public
access to the inspection reports</a> but no bulk data on them. So, in a
<a
href="https://biglocalnews.org/content/news/2023/02/21/usda-animal-inspection-database.html">collaboration</a>
between <a href="https://biglocalnews.org/content/about/">Big Local
News</a> and the <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data
Liberation Project</a> (same disclosure as above), <a
href="https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/">Ben Welsh</a> and I <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/aphis-inspection-reports/blob/main/METHODOLOGY.md">wrote
code</a> to fetch the 80,000+ (and counting) inspections going back to
2014, parse their PDFs, and <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/aphis-inspection-reports">make
the data more accessible</a>. The information includes each inspection’s
date, type, licensee, violation counts, species inspected, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Daily European gas imports.</strong> Researchers at <a
href="https://www.bruegel.org/bruegel-european-think-tank-specialises-economics">Bruegel</a>
are <a
href="https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/european-natural-gas-imports">tracking
daily and weekly natural gas imports to Europe</a>, using data from the
<a href="https://www.entsog.eu/">European Network of Transmission System
Operators for Gas</a>’s <a
href="https://transparency.entsog.eu/">transparency portal</a>.
Alongside the imports, which they’re aggregating by source (e.g.,
Russia, Norway, Algeria) and by route (e.g., Nord Stream, TurkStream),
the researchers are also tracking <a href="https://agsi.gie.eu/">gas
storage levels</a>, using data from <a href="https://www.gie.eu/">Gas

Vacantia division</a> publishes a <a
href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/unclaimed-estates-list">dataset
of unclaimed estates</a> — inheritances that nobody has claimed yet to
inherit. The entries indicate the deceased person’s name, aliases,
date/place of birth and death, marital status, and more.

<p><strong>Fair market rents.</strong> Every year, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development recalculates what it calls “fair market
rents” <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html">for
every county in the US</a> and <a
href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr/smallarea/index.html">for
individual ZIP codes in metropolitan counties</a>. The results, which
factor into various housing subsidy programs, <a
href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/24/888.113">represent</a> the
40th percentile cost of monthly rent and (basic) utilities for “recent
movers” in “standard quality” units, adjusted for the number of
bedrooms. HUD’s annual spreadsheets go back to the early 2000s; you can
also browse the estimates online and <a

identification number</a>, make, model, and year; for other types of
recalls, you can search by brand and model. The agency also provides a
<a

<p><strong>Prison-banned books.</strong> The Marshall Project is
building a <a
href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/21/prison-banned-books-list-find-your-state">database
of books banned from state prisons</a>, based on official lists that
reporters requested from each state’s correctional agency. The browsable
and <a
href="https://observablehq.com/@themarshallproject/prison-banned-books">downloadable</a>
database includes roughly 50,000 entries from 18 states so far, with
plans for expansion. The fields include the book’s title, author, date
banned, and reason for banning, although availability varies by state.
(Disclosure: I did some <a
