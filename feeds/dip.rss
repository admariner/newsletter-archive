<p> </p>
<p><strong>Income patterns.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.grid-database.org/">Global Repository of Income
Dynamics</a> is a <a
href="https://twitter.com/fatihguvenen/status/1576960664534683648">new</a>
“open-access international database that provides a wealth of micro
statistics on income inequality and income dynamics.” It was <a
href="https://www.grid-database.org/documentation">constructed</a> by an
<a href="https://www.grid-database.org/team">international team of
economists</a> using longitudinal administrative data and “designed from
ground up with a focus on comparability across countries.” The project’s
<a href="https://data.grid-database.org/">data access tool</a> provides
stats ranging from the widely-understood (e.g., share of income going to
the top 1%) to the more specialized (e.g., <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis">kurtosis</a> coefficients
of various income-change distributions). It currently covers 13
countries (although access to the UK’s data is listed as “coming soon”),
with timespans that typically stretch from the 1980s or 1990s to the
mid/late-2010s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mine safety.</strong> The Department of Labor’s <a
href="https://www.msha.gov/">Mine Safety and Health Administration</a>
“develops and enforces safety and health rules for all U.S. mines
regardless of size, number of employees, commodity mined, or method of
extraction.” Its <a
href="https://www.msha.gov/mine-data-retrieval-system">Mine Data
Retrieval System</a> provides a search interface and downloads of
records collected through this oversight role, including detailed
information about individual accidents since January 2000, civil
penalties, coal dust samples, mine owner and operator histories,
employment and production levels, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Still’s freedom-seekers.</strong> <a
href="http://stillfamily.library.temple.edu/stillfamily/exhibits/show/william-still">William
Still</a>, a Philadelphia-based abolitionist and key leader of the
Underground Railroad, kept records of the freedom-seekers he helped to
escape the South, details of which he recounted in <a
href="https://archive.org/details/undergroundrailr00stil/page/n7/mode/2up">his
1872 magnum opus</a>. In the early 2000s, the late <a

A. McGowan compiled those descriptions into a spreadsheet</a> listing
each runaway’s name, gender, age, date of escape, enslaver’s name, and
more. <a href="https://www.historylive.net/">William C. Kashatus</a>’s
<a href="https://undpress.nd.edu/9780268200367/william-still/">2021
biography of Still</a> draws on McGowan’s efforts and other records to
construct a listing of 995 runaways whom Still assisted, which historian

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sierra snowpack.</strong> For decades, UC Berkeley’s <a
href="https://cssl.berkeley.edu/">Central Sierra Snow Lab</a> has been
collecting daily temperature, snowfall, snowpack, and related
measurements at its field station near Donner Pass. Until recently, the
records were available only upon request. That <a
href="https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/about/news/snowpack-data">changed
last year</a>, when the lab published a <a
href="https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.6078%2FD1941T">fully-public
dataset of the daily measurements for October 1970 to September
2019</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The turkey industry.</strong> The USDA’s <a

Service</a> publishes monthly and annual reports estimating the number
of turkeys <a

<p><strong>Nuclear stockpiles.</strong> As of early 2022, a total of
nine countries possessed approximately 12,700 nuclear warheads,
according to <a
href="https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/">estimates
from the Federation of American Scientists</a>. Although “the exact
number of nuclear weapons in each country’s possession is a closely held
national secret,” the researchers say that “publicly available
information, careful analysis of historical records, and occasional
leaks” make the estimates possible, albeit “with significant
uncertainty.” The report includes each country’s current warhead count
and subtotals by status, as well as annual totals for each country since
1945. <strong>As seen in</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Decades of river widths.</strong> <a
href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021WR031712">Dongmei
Feng et al.</a> have applied an algorithmic approach to calculating the
<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/6425657#.Y2AxIILMI-Q">widths of the
world’s largest rivers over time</a>. Their dataset contains more than 1

<p><strong>Flood insurance changes.</strong> FEMA <a
href="https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/risk-rating">recently
revamped</a> its method of pricing US flood insurance, aiming for “rates
that are actuarily sound, equitable, easier to understand and better
reflect a property’s flood risk.” A <a
href="https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/risk-rating/profiles">series
of datasets and dashboards</a> from the agency summarize the expected
changes in premiums, which began taking effect last year. They count the
number of policies for which monthly payments were projected to
increase/decrease by a given amount, bucketed into ten-dollar
increments, for each state, county, and ZIP code. <strong>As seen
in</strong>: “<a

<p><strong>The weight of the web.</strong> Researchers at the <a
href="https://httparchive.org/">HTTP Archive</a>, a project of the <a
href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, “periodically crawl
the top sites on the web and record detailed information about fetched
resources, used web platform APIs and features, and execution traces of
each page.” They make the raw data <a

<p><strong>Swiss apartment layouts.</strong> <a
href="https://zenodo.org/record/7215005">Swiss Dwellings</a> “contains
detailed data on over 42,500 apartments (250,000 rooms) in ~3,100
buildings including their geometries, room typology as well as their
visual, acoustical, topological and daylight characteristics,” collected
by <a href="https://www.archilyse.com/">Archilyse AG</a>, a company that

Borgatti</a> set 17,000+ daily tasks for himself. He completed slightly
less than half of them. He labeled them with tags such as “@meeting”,
“@talk”, and “@clojure”. He estimated how many “<a

<p><strong>FDA inspections.</strong> The US Food and Drug
Administration’s <a

dashboard</a> lists 264,000+ assessments of facilities (primarily those
manufacturing food, drugs, and other FDA-regulated products) and
227,000+ problems the inspectors found. The fields include the facility
owner, location, product type, inspection completion date, and outcomes.
The records, which go back to fiscal year 2009, can be bulk-downloaded
from the dashboard and queried via <a
href="https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/api/index.htm">an API</a>. They
come with certain caveats; they exclude, for instance, “inspections
waiting for a final enforcement action” and those conducted by state

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Labor turnover, biodiversity trends, probabilistic predictions,
working artists, and Atari emails.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Labor turnover.</strong> The US Bureau of Labor Statistics’
monthly <a href="https://www.bls.gov/jlt/">Job Openings and Labor
Turnover Survey</a> estimates the number of jobs that people quit, how
many people were fired or laid off, the number of new hires, and the
current number of open positions. Those estimates, based on data <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/jlt/data.htm">gathered from a sample
of businesses across the country</a>, are available to <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/jlt/data.htm">download and query</a> by state,
industry, and business size. They <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/jlt/jltdef.htm">include most types of
workers</a>, regardless of whether they’re full-time or part-time,
permanent or seasonal, salaried or hourly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Biodiversity trends.</strong> <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12729">Maria
Dornelas et al.</a>’s <a
href="https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/">BioTIME</a> project has
collected and standardized data from hundreds of studies examining
ecological communities over time. You can <a
href="https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/download.php">browse and search
the studies</a> by year, taxa, species, and biome. You can also <a
href="https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/downloadFull.php">download the
full dataset</a>, which provides information about each study (biome,
start/end years, number of species tallied, and much more) and each
sample collected (date, location, species, abundance, and biomass).

Biodiversity in the United States</a>,” by Yuanning Liang et al.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Probabilistic predictions.</strong> <a
href="https://www.metaculus.com/about/">Metaculus</a> is a forecasting
platform whose community has registered <a
href="https://twitter.com/fianxu/status/1569537658103431168">more than 1
million predictions</a> on questions such as “<a
href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/10004/german-nuclear-power/">Will
a major nuclear power plant in Germany be operational on June 1,
2023?</a>” The <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/api2/">website’s
API</a> provides data on <a
href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/">questions posed</a>, <a
href="https://www.metaculus.com/rankings/">user rankings</a>, and other
aspects of the platform. For each question, you can see its phrasing,
date posed, creator, prediction type, the distribution of predictions,
and more. <strong>Related</strong>: <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Working artists.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.arts.gov/about">National Endowment for the Arts</a>
regularly produces <a
href="https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/arts-data-profile-series">statistical
profiles of the arts in the United States</a>. The latest, “<a

tabulated from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. It <a

employment and earning estimates by artistic occupation and demographic.

<p><strong>Atari emails.</strong> A couple of decades ago, <a
href="https://www.jmargolin.com/">Jed Margolin</a> posted a <a
href="https://www.jmargolin.com/vmail/vmail.htm">cache of electronic
mail messages</a> from his time as a video game hardware engineer at
Atari (and Atari Games, a successor company). In 2017, with Margolin’s
permission, <a href="https://twitter.com/voberoi">Vikram Oberoi</a>
scraped the 4,000+ emails and built <a
href="https://atariemailarchive.org/">atariemailarchive.org</a>, which
groups the messages into <a

href="https://atariemailarchive.org/categories">categories</a>, and a <a
href="https://atariemailarchive.org/top-threads">list of favorites</a>.
The project also includes a <a
href="https://github.com/voberoi/atariemailarchive-data">database
file</a> containing each message’s sender, recipients, timestamp,
subject, body, and Oberoi’s thread grouping. <strong>Related</strong>:

<p><strong>Voter ID laws.</strong> As part of his PhD research, <a

a <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/RU2F9A">dataset
of voter identification requirements around the world</a>. For each
country and US state, the dataset indicates the type of identification
needed to vote (a photo ID, non-photo ID, or just basic personal
details), how many forms of identification the voter must provide, and
more. <strong>Related</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Local internet speeds.</strong> If you’ve tried measuring
your internet speed, you might have used <a

series of <a
href="https://github.com/teamookla/ookla-open-data">quarterly datasets
that summarize the test results</a>, aggregated into geospatial tiles.
(The tile sizes vary by latitude but measure roughly 2,000 feet by 2,000
feet at the equator.) For each tile, the datasets list the number of
tests performed and devices tested, plus the average download speed,
upload speed, and latency. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a
