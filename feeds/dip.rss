      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Aviation accident investigations, the top of BuzzFeed News, forty
years of financial reforms, parking reforms, and protected European
ham.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Aviation accident investigations.</strong> Through its <a
href="https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-main-public/landing-page">Case
Analysis and Reporting Online service</a>, the National Transportation
Safety Board provides information about all US civil aviation accident
investigations since 1983; <a
href="https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/AviationQuery.aspx">another NTSB
tool</a> includes earlier cases, going back to 1963. The agency also
provides <a href="https://data.ntsb.gov/avdata">bulk data downloads</a>,
covering the full span. Those files link each investigated event to
details regarding the aircraft involved, engines, crew,
injuries/fatalities, narratives, findings, and more.
<strong>Related</strong>: In February, the agency <a
href="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20230215.aspx">launched</a>
an <a
href="https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/data/Pages/GeneralAviationDashboard.aspx">interactive
dashboard</a> summarizing accidents from 2012 to 2021. [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The top of BuzzFeed News.</strong> You’ve likely heard:
BuzzFeed Inc. has <a
href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1828972/000182897223000062/bzfd-20230420.htm">shut
down BuzzFeed News</a>, where I worked from 2014 to early 2022. In July
2018, the newsroom launched its own website, <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.buzzfeednews.com/">BuzzFeedNews.com</a>,
distinct from BuzzFeed.com. The top of the new homepage <a
href="https://github.com/jsvine/buzzfeed-news-trending-strip/blob/main/misc/trending-strip-screenshot.png">featured</a>
a “Trending” strip, with links to a handful of <a
href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/buzzfeed-news/">editor-selected</a>
articles. A few months later, I wrote a computer script to save the
text, URL, and position of each link on the strip. My personal server
ran that script every five minutes (with occasional interruptions) until
the newsroom’s final day of operation on May 5. <a
href="https://github.com/jsvine/buzzfeed-news-trending-strip/">Here’s
what it saw</a>. <strong>Read more</strong>: “<a
href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/buzzfeednews/buzzfeed-news-oral-history-2012-2023">The
Ultimate Oral History Of BuzzFeed News</a>,” as told by many of my
wonderful former colleagues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Forty years of financial reforms.</strong> A decade-plus ago,
a team of IMF economists published “<a
href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/A-New-Database-of-Financial-Reforms-22485">A
New Database of Financial Reforms</a>,” recording changes to financial
policy in 91 economies from 1973 to 2005. They did so “along seven
different dimensions: credit controls and reserve requirements, interest
rate controls, entry barriers, state ownership, policies on securities
markets, banking regulations, and restrictions on the capital account.”
Last year, <a href="https://sawaomori.jpn.org/">Sawa Omori</a>, a
political scientist who assisted with that project, <a
href="https://academic.oup.com/jfr/article/8/2/230/6627259">introduced</a>
a <a href="https://sawaomori.jpn.org/data/">revised and updated
version</a>, expanding the coverage to 100 economies, extending it
through 2013, and refining the seven original dimensions into 20
subdimensions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Parking reforms.</strong> The <a
href="https://parkingreform.org/">Parking Reform Network</a>, a US-based
nonprofit that <a
href="https://parkingreform.org/what-is-parking-reform/">aims</a> “to
discourage the building of too much parking supply,” has compiled a <a
href="https://parkingreform.org/resources/mandates-map/">map and dataset
of ~1,400 relevant local mandates</a>. They focus on policies that
reduce or eliminate <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_minimums_and_maximums">minimum
parking requirements</a> for new developments, or set maximums. For each
mandate, the dataset provides a summary and indicates its location,
status, category, geographic scope, affected land use, and more.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Protected European ham.</strong> In the world of food and
wine, <a
href="https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/enforcement-and-protection/protecting-eu-creations-inventions-and-designs/geographical-indications_en">geographical
indications</a> protect traditional local producers against imitators —
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne">Champagne</a> being a
famous example. To explore the relationship between protected region
size and product price, <a
href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00343404.2023.2187365">Gero
Laurenz Höhn et al.</a> have collected the <a
href="https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/RX0QIN">prices
of protected and non-protected European ham</a> from dozens of
supermarket websites. The 22 protected varieties in the dataset (such as
Italy’s <a
href="https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/farming/geographical-indications-and-quality-schemes/geographical-indications-food-and-drink/prosciutto-di-parma-pdo_en">Prosciutto

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Controlled substances lost and stolen, international case law,
ICE database misconduct, real effective exchange rates, and collective
nouns.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Controlled substances lost and stolen.</strong> In response
to a <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation
Project</a> Freedom of Information Act <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/controlled-substance-theft-and-loss/">request</a>,
the US Drug Enforcement Administration last week sent me <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/dea-theft-and-loss-counts">data
counting the thefts and other losses</a> of <a
href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/">controlled
substances</a> and “<a
href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/chem_prog/34chems.htm">listed
chemicals</a>” that regulated entities have reported to the agency. The
DEA <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/dea-theft-and-loss-counts/">provided
the records</a> as <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/dea-theft-and-loss-counts/tree/main/data/raw">two
spreadsheet files</a>, which I’ve also <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/dea-theft-and-loss-counts/tree/main/data/tidy">converted
into tidy CSVs</a>. They indicate the number of incidents by state, type
of business (pharmacy, importer, distributor, etc.), and type of loss
(burglary, hijacking, natural disaster, etc.), plus the total quantities
stolen/lost. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a
href="https://buttondown.email/data-liberation-project/archive/dlp-dispatch-8/">Yesterday’s
Data Liberation Project newsletter</a>, featuring some numbers that
caught my eye.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>International case law.</strong> “The quantitative analysis
of international legal data is still in its infancy, a situation which
is exacerbated by the lack of high-quality open access data sets,”
writes <a href="https://seanfobbe.com/">Seán Fobbe</a> in a <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12313">2022 paper
in Journal of Empirical Legal Studies</a>. To this end, Fobbe’s
“present[s] the first two of a new series” of such resources, “covering
one hundred years of case law of the primary judicial organs of the
United Nations and the League of Nations.” The datasets — <a
href="https://zenodo.org/record/7051934">for the Permanent Court of
International Justice</a> (covering 1922–1940) and <a
href="https://zenodo.org/record/7876286">for the International Court of
Justice</a> (1947–present) — include case metadata, linguistic metrics,
and the full text (in English and French) of the courts’ opinions,
orders, and other key documents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ICE database misconduct.</strong> “Since 2016, hundreds of US
Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees and contractors have faced
internal investigations into abuse of confidential law enforcement
databases and agency computers,” <a
href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agent-database-abuse-records/">Dhruv
Mehrotra reports in Wired</a>, based on <a
href="https://airtable.com/shrodU77cgvD2e8dc/tblwELYkSA0fNXgKF">disciplinary
database records</a> Mehrotra obtained via a Freedom of Information Act
request. ICE provided 414 rows of records. Each represents an alleged
misconduct incident and provides a summary, date of occurrence, date
reported, location, several categorizations, case resolution, and more.
Wired has also added a column identifying the database in question,
based on the summary. [h/t <a

Couts</a> + <a href="https://vis.social/@seblammers">Sebastian
Lammers</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Weighted, inflation-adjusted exchange rates.</strong> A
country’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reer.asp">real
effective exchange rate</a> is its average exchange rate with its
trading partners, weighted by trade volume and adjusted for inflation.
Economist <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/people/zsolt-darvas">Zsolt
Darvas</a> maintains a <a
href="https://www.bruegel.org/publications/datasets/real-effective-exchange-rates-for-178-countries-a-new-database">dataset</a>
that <a
href="https://www.bruegel.org/working-paper/timely-measurement-real-effective-exchange-rates">estimates</a>
these rates for 178 countries and the eurozone, by month and year. The
project, which updates a <a
href="https://www.bruegel.org/working-paper/real-effective-exchange-rates-178-countries-new-database">dataset
and methodology Darvas first published in 2012</a>, uses data from
international organizations, national statistics offices, and central
banks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Collective nouns.</strong> <a
href="https://sites.miamioh.edu/meyersde/">Daniel E. Meyers</a> has
consulted dozens of sources to compile <a
href="https://sites.miamioh.edu/meyersde/the-collective-noun-catalog/">The
Collective Noun Catalog</a>, which presents an <em>inundation</em> of
7,300+ such constructs, such as a <em>pulse</em> of cardiologists and a
<em>warren</em> of wombats. The <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xCYrcJYhZVHNaF2J5oIgiFsROF--ZDzl68VFS8HzNUQ/edit">project’s
spreadsheet</a> lists each collective noun’s subject, category, notes,
and primary sources — some of which date to the 1400s.</p>

<p><strong>Prison demographics.</strong> In a recent paper in
<em>Nature</em>, <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05980-2">Brennan Klein
et al.</a> describe how they “manually assembled and validated a dataset
covering all 50 US states, the District of Columbia and the Federal
Bureau of Prisons to both quantify the widening racial disparity
observed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncover its
plausible causes.” Their <a
href="https://github.com/jkbren/incarcerated-populations-data">Dataset
on Incarcerated Populations</a> provides the monthly number (<a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05980-2#MOESM1">or
interpolated estimates</a>) of people, by race/ethnicity, in each prison
system. The dataset goes back at least to 2010 for most states; for 18
states, it also includes admission/release counts.
<strong>Related</strong>: The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ <a

Residential Land Use Regulatory Index</a>’s prior, survey-based
research. The database includes dozens of indicators, such as whether
the rules specify annual limits on several types of permits, allow any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_suite">accessory
dwelling units</a>, require various review-board approvals, impose
parking space minimums, and more. These factors then feed into the

href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/daily-treasury-statement/operating-cash-balance">Daily
Treasury Statement dataset</a> paints a near-real-time picture of the
federal government’s purse. The eight tables provide data on “operating
cash balance, deposits and withdrawals of cash, public debt
transactions, federal tax deposits, income tax refunds issued,” and
more. The table of deposits and withdrawals, for example, indicates the
total value (rounded to the nearest $1 million) of transactions each
day, by type and category (e.g., “Economic Recovery Programs,” “Defense
Vendor Payments,” etc.). The records, available to download in bulk or
<a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/api-documentation/">via
API</a>, go back to October 2005. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

<p><strong>European buildings.</strong> <a
href="https://eubucco.com/">EUBUCCO</a> is a “database of individual
building footprints for 200+ million buildings across the 27 European
Union countries and Switzerland, together with three main attributes –
building type, height and construction year – included for respectively
45%, 74%, 24% of the buildings.” The researchers, who describe their
methodology in a <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02040-2">recent
paper</a>, collected and standardized the information from 50 open
government datasets and OpenStreetMap. They then “perform[ed] extensive
validation analyses to assess the quality, consistency and completeness
of the data in every country.” You can <a

<p><strong>911 service areas.</strong> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_safety_answering_point">Public
Safety Answering Points</a> (PSAPs) are, essentially, the call centers
to which 911 calls are routed. A while ago, the US government hired a
contractor to compile a <a
href="https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/geoplatform::psap-911-service-area-boundaries/explore">dataset
of the service area boundaries</a> for each of the country’s PSAPs, “the
geographic area within which a 911 call placed using a landline is
answered at the associated PSAP.” Although some of that information has
likely changed since the dataset’s publication in 2009, the records may
still be useful for certain purposes. <strong>Related</strong>: The
FCC’s <a
href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/9-1-1-master-psap-registry">911 Master
PSAP Registry</a>, which doesn’t include service boundaries but does
provide the name, state, county, and ID of 6,000+ primary PSAPs, plus
2,700+ PSAPs listed as “secondary,” “duplicate,” or “orphaned.” [h/t <a

entirety</a> — five concise episodes, each based on data previously
featured in this newsletter. This is my first time creating a podcast,
and I still have lots to learn. So please do let me know what you think;
critiques and suggestions for improvement particularly appreciated. And

which is based on 130,000+ YouTube-hosted videos of such meetings in
1,000+ US cities and counties, covering the years 2006 to 2022. The
dataset lists each meeting’s date, jurisdiction, and government body
(e.g., municipal council, school board, etc.), plus the video’s ID,

<p><strong>Health workers.</strong> The World Health Organization’s <a

Health Workforce Statistics database</a> presents annual, national
estimates of the number of medical doctors, nursing and midwifery
professionals, community health workers, and several other types of
health personnel. The estimates come from the WHO’s <a
href="https://www.who.int/activities/improving-health-workforce-data-and-evidence">National
Health Workforce Accounts system</a>, national censuses, labor force
surveys, and other sources. For medical doctors, the estimates span
nearly 200 countries, with the majority having estimates as recent as
2020 or 2021. Twenty countries’ estimates go back to the 1960s (and, for
Spain, all the way back to 1952). [h/t <a

a <a href="https://ukraine.bellingcat.com/">map and dataset of 1,000+
incidents</a> “that have resulted in potential civilian impact or harm
since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.” They include incidents
“where rockets or missiles struck civilian areas,” “where attacks have
resulted in the destruction of civilian infrastructure,” and/or where
visual evidence depicts civilian injuries or “immobile civilian bodies.”
The information, <a
