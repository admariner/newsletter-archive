<p><strong>Ukraine border crossing sites.</strong> The UN’s <a
href="https://www.unocha.org/ukraine">Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs in Ukraine</a> has combined information from
multiple sources to create a <a
href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ukraine-border-crossings">geospatial
dataset of the country’s international border crossings</a> with Moldova
(11 crossings listed), Poland (8), Hungary (5), Romania (4), and
Slovakia (2). It provides each crossing’s latitude, longitude, border
country, and name in both Ukrainian and English. The associated metadata
indicates an “expected update frequency” of weekly.</p>

<p><strong>Conspiracy theory language.</strong> <a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-021-01698-z">Alessandro
Miani et al.</a> have built a <a
href="https://osf.io/snpcg/">dataset</a> to study the language of
conspiracy theories. Starting with a set of phrases associated with
major conspiracy theories (e.g., those surrounding Princess Diana’s
death), the authors searched online for sources that mentioned them
often, ultimately selecting 150 websites — both mainstream and
conspiracy-laden — that met their criteria. Then, in mid-2020, they
collected 72,000+ topical articles from those sites. For each article,
the project includes its text, lexical features, and metadata. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Refugees fleeing Ukraine.</strong> The UN’s refugee agency
last week <a
href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/announc/2022/3/621f5e334/launch-unhcr-data-portal-ukraine-refugee-situation.html">launched</a>
a data portal <a
href="https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine">tracking the
arrival of refugees from Ukraine in other countries</a>. The
daily-updated maps, charts, and structured data provide counts and
estimates of arrivals by date, by receiving country, and overall.
<strong>Related</strong>: The UN’s <a

Project</a>, <a
href="https://sites.duke.edu/icbdata/project-info/">initiated in
1975</a>, collects detailed data about interstate military-security
crises such as the <a

<p><strong>Prison COVID policies.</strong> Between April 2020 and April
2021, researchers at the <a href="https://uclacovidbehindbars.org/">UCLA
Law COVID Behind Bars Data Project</a> gathered 3,500+ policy
announcements from federal and state prison agencies in the US. Their <a

<p><strong>Commuting zones.</strong> Decades ago, the USDA <a

a methodology to group the nation’s counties into hundreds of “<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting_zone">commuting
zones</a>,” based on the Census’s <a
href="https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/commuting.html">journey
to work</a> data. Those groupings are available <a
href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commuting-zones-and-labor-market-areas/">from
the agency</a> (for 1980, 1990, and 2000), and <a
href="https://sites.psu.edu/psucz/">from researchers at Penn State</a>
(for those years plus 2010). More recently, Facebook/Meta <a
href="https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/commuting-zones">has
developed</a> its <a
href="https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/docs/methodology-commuting-zones">own
methodology</a> for estimating commuting zones, using location data
collected from its users. The project’s <a

counties but as detailed, custom boundaries.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Slaveholders in Congress, pension plans, journal editors, radio
on the internet, and chocolate bar reviews.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>👋 Some updates: After nearly eight (very fulfilling) years as
BuzzFeed News’ data editor, I’m shifting roles there — I’ll be working
part-time (for now) on a new initiative that I’m quite excited about.
More details on that soonish. In the meantime, two related developments:
✨ <a
href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/buzzfeed/jobs/3758781?gh_jid=3758781">we’re
hiring a new data editor</a> ✨ (ask me about it!) and I’ve added a ✨

Is Plural (see below).</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Slaveholders in Congress.</strong> At least “1,715 members of
Congress were enslavers at some point in their adult lives,” according
to a <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/congress-slaveowners-names-list/">Washington
Post investigation published Monday</a>. Reporter <a
href="https://twitter.com/juliezweil">Julie Zauzmer Weil</a> began her
research with a list of <a
href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators">every person
who ever served in the House or Senate</a>, filtered it to those born
before 1840, and then consulted <a
href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/">their biographies</a>, Census
records, and other historical documents. The Post’s <a
href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-congress-slaveowners/">public
dataset</a>, the first of its kind, lists the congressmen from that era,
their dates of birth, positions held in Congress, states served, dates
served, and whether the Post determined they were slaveholders. For 677
of the congressmen, the Post “couldn’t reach a conclusion” and <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/submit-congress-enslaved-database/">is
seeking assistance from readers</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pension plans.</strong> <a

href="https://publicplansdata.org/about/our-research">collaboration</a>
led by Boston College professor <a
href="https://publicplansdata.org/about/bios/munnell/">Alicia H.
Munnell</a>, gathers extensive information about the retirement plans
that state and local governments offer their employees, drawn from <a
href="https://publicplansdata.org/resources/download-avs-cafrs/">those
plans’ annual financial reports</a>. The project maintains a <a
href="https://publicplansdata.org/public-plans-database/download-full-data-set/">range
of datasets</a>, including two decades of participation and financial
figures for 200+ plans that account for “95 percent of public pension

<p><strong>Civil asset forfeiture.</strong> “Most states and the federal
government have laws allowing police and prosecutors to seize and
permanently keep Americans’ cash, cars, homes and other property
suspected of being involved in a crime — without regard to the owners’
guilt or innocence,” the nonprofit law firm <a
href="https://ij.org/about-us/">Institute for Justice</a> writes in its
<a href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/">third edition of
<em>Policing for Profit</em></a>, published in 2020. The report gathers
and analyzes <a
href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/policing-for-profit-data/">datasets
on property seized in dozens of states</a> through this practice of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States">civil
asset forfeiture</a>, and on the spending of forfeiture funds. It also
examines seizures from the federal <a

<p><strong>Joint military exercises.</strong> Jordan Bernhardt’s <a

Military Exercises Dataset</a> describes 5,000+ such operations
undertaken between 1977 and 2016, drawn from historical news reports.
The dataset lists each exercise’s name, location, when it began and
ended, the countries that participated, activities involved, and more.

<p><strong>Local mortality and the 1918 pandemic.</strong> <a
href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zf6wy/">Martin Eiermann,
Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, et al.</a> have conducted an analysis of deaths
before, during, and after the 1918 influenza pandemic, drawing on “data
from multiple sources, including digitized mortality records for 70 U.S.
cities, linked census records that establish urban residency status
across multiple censuses” and newspaper accounts of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-pharmaceutical_intervention_(epidemiology)">non-pharmaceutical
interventions</a>. The team’s <a href="https://osf.io/njghd/">published
files</a> includes a dataset that, for each city-and-year, lists the
mortality rate overall, for white vs. non-white residents, and due to
flu/pneumonia; a range of demographic variables; the timing of certain
interventions; and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Religious congregations.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.thearda.com/">Association of Religion Data
Archives</a>, founded in 1997, “strives to democratize access to the
best data on religion.” Among <a
href="https://www.thearda.com/Archive/browse.asp">its resources</a> are
<a href="https://www.thearda.com/Archive/NCS.asp">four waves of the
National Congregations Study</a>, a <a
href="https://sites.duke.edu/ncsweb/">Duke University–based survey</a>
that <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/ncsweb/methodology/">asks US
religious establishments</a> about their denominational affiliation,
buildings of worship, congregants, staffing, educational offerings, and
more. Representatives from 5,300+ Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist,
Hindu, and other congregations participated in the latest wave,
conducted in 2018–19. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Tobacco habits.</strong> Every few years since 1992, the <a
href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/">National Cancer Institute</a>
has sponsored the <a
href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/tcrb/tus-cps">Tobacco Use
Supplement to the Current Population Survey</a>, <a
href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/about/supplemental-surveys.html">administered
by the US Census Bureau</a>. In addition to extensive demographic
information, the supplement asks about historical tobacco usage (“Have
you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?”), preferences
(“Do you usually smoke menthol or non-menthol cigarettes?”), purchasing
habits, e-cigarettes, and much more. Anonymized responses and
documentation <a
href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/tcrb/tus-cps/questionnaires-data">are
available</a> for all survey waves through 2018–19.
