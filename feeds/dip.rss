      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>WHO outbreak alerts, census tract urbanization, local digital
news, research organizations, and teenagers on TV.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHO outbreak alerts.</strong> The World Health Organization’s
<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news">Disease
Outbreak News</a> provides “information on confirmed acute public health
events or potential events of concern,” with reports issued when those
events meet certain criteria. <a
href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.22.22272790v1">Colin
J. Carlson et al.</a> have assembled a <a
href="https://github.com/cghss/dons">dataset of all 2,700+ reports</a>
published between January 1996 and December 2019; it includes report
metadata (date and headline, for example), as well as variables drawn
from the descriptive text, such as the diseases discussed, countries
affected, case counts, whether the report implicates mass gatherings,
and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Census tract urbanization.</strong> Studies of US
urbanization often examine census tracts, but those boundaries have
changed over time and <a
href="https://twitter.com/snmarkley/status/1502268920593592321">are
relatively new</a> in <a
href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/programs/geography/tracts_and_block_numbering_areas.html">many
parts of the country</a>. To aid longitudinal analyses, <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01184-x">Scott N.
Markley et al.</a> have taken 2010’s tract boundaries and used several
techniques to estimate the number of housing units within them every
decade from 1940 to 2010, plus 2019. The <a
href="https://osf.io/fzv5e/">dataset</a> also estimates each tract’s
“urbanization year,” when it surpassed 200 units per square mile.

Tract Data Base</a>, which also provides historical estimates of housing
units (and other Census variables) matched to 2010 tracts, going back to
1970.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Local digital news.</strong> <a
href="https://www.projectnewsoasis.com/">Project Oasis</a>, which aims
to “map and showcase the growing number of locally focused digital news
publications in the U.S. and Canada,” has collected data on 700+ such
organizations. Its <a
href="https://www.projectnewsoasis.com/publications">downloadable,
browsable dataset</a> describes their ownership, tax status, years in
operation, communities served, and other characteristics. A <a
href="https://www.sembramedia.org/projectoasis/">parallel effort is
underway in Europe</a>, with plans to publish a final report in early
2023. [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Research organizations.</strong> The <a
href="https://ror.org/">Research Organization Registry</a> is “a
community-led project to develop an open, sustainable, usable, and
unique identifier for every research organization in the world.” Earlier
this month, the project <a
href="https://zenodo.org/record/6347575">published</a> its <a
href="https://ror.org/blog/2022-03-17-2022-first-independent-release/">first
“independent” release</a>, expanding on data seeded from a <a
href="https://www.digital-science.com/press-release/grid-passes-torch-to-ror/">prior
initiative</a>. It contains the names, location, contact information,
and <a href="https://ror.readme.io/docs/ror-data-structure">other
structured information</a> for 100,000+ organizations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Teenagers on TV.</strong> In search of “a better
understanding of the age differences between teen characters in TV shows
and the actors who portray them,” <a
href="https://amber.rbind.io/">Amber Thomas</a> last year manually
compiled <a
href="https://data.world/amberthomas/age-of-characters-and-actors-in-teen-tv-shows">data
on 240+ characters</a> in 33 series that premiered between 2000 and
2021. For each character, Thomas’s dataset lists their name, fictional
age/grade, gender, and love interests, as well as the actor’s name and
birth date.</p>

between January 2009 and June 2021 — the distance you would have to
travel to the nearest abortion facility. Researchers can also <a

the agency</a> (for 1980, 1990, and 2000), and <a

(for those years plus 2010). More recently, Facebook/Meta <a

developed</a> its <a
href="https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/docs/methodology-commuting-zones">own
methodology</a> for estimating commuting zones, using location data
collected from its users. The project’s <a

dataset</a> spans the world and specifies the zones not as sets of
counties but as detailed, custom boundaries.</p>

on the internet, and chocolate bar reviews.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>👋 Some updates: After nearly eight (very fulfilling) years as
BuzzFeed News’ data editor, I’m shifting roles there — I’ll be working
part-time (for now) on a new initiative that I’m quite excited about.
More details on that soonish. In the meantime, two related developments:
✨ <a
href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/buzzfeed/jobs/3758781?gh_jid=3758781">we’re
hiring a new data editor</a> ✨ (ask me about it!) and I’ve added a ✨
<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/jobs">job board</a> ✨ to Data
Is Plural (see below).</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Slaveholders in Congress.</strong> At least “1,715 members of
Congress were enslavers at some point in their adult lives,” according
to a <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/congress-slaveowners-names-list/">Washington
Post investigation published Monday</a>. Reporter <a
href="https://twitter.com/juliezweil">Julie Zauzmer Weil</a> began her
research with a list of <a
href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators">every person
who ever served in the House or Senate</a>, filtered it to those born
before 1840, and then consulted <a
href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/">their biographies</a>, Census
records, and other historical documents. The Post’s <a
href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-congress-slaveowners/">public
dataset</a>, the first of its kind, lists the congressmen from that era,
their dates of birth, positions held in Congress, states served, dates
served, and whether the Post determined they were slaveholders. For 677
of the congressmen, the Post “couldn’t reach a conclusion” and <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/submit-congress-enslaved-database/">is
seeking assistance from readers</a>.</p>

Munnell</a>, gathers extensive information about the retirement plans
that state and local governments offer their employees, drawn from <a
href="https://publicplansdata.org/resources/download-avs-cafrs/">those
plans’ annual financial reports</a>. The project maintains a <a
href="https://publicplansdata.org/public-plans-database/download-full-data-set/">range
of datasets</a>, including two decades of participation and financial
figures for 200+ plans that account for “95 percent of public pension

options, and more. It also provides <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Civil asset forfeiture.</strong> “Most states and the federal
government have laws allowing police and prosecutors to seize and
permanently keep Americans’ cash, cars, homes and other property
suspected of being involved in a crime — without regard to the owners’
guilt or innocence,” the nonprofit law firm <a
href="https://ij.org/about-us/">Institute for Justice</a> writes in its
<a href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/">third edition of
<em>Policing for Profit</em></a>, published in 2020. The report gathers
and analyzes <a
href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/policing-for-profit-data/">datasets
on property seized in dozens of states</a> through this practice of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States">civil
asset forfeiture</a>, and on the spending of forfeiture funds. It also
examines seizures from the federal <a
href="https://www.justice.gov/jmd/major-information-systems-consolidated-asset-tracking-system">Consolidated
Asset Tracking System</a>, <a
href="https://www.justice.gov/afp/freedom-information-act">detailed
public extracts</a> of which the Department of Justice updates
quarterly. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a
href="https://thewhyaxis.substack.com/p/cops-still-take-more-stuff-from-people">Cops
still take more stuff from people than burglars do</a>” (The Why Axis,
2021), and “<a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2014/09/06/stop-and-seize/">Stop
and Seize</a>” (Washington Post, 2014).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Joint military exercises.</strong> Jordan Bernhardt’s <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HXQFHU">Joint
Military Exercises Dataset</a> describes 5,000+ such operations
undertaken between 1977 and 2016, drawn from historical news reports.
The dataset lists each exercise’s name, location, when it began and
ended, the countries that participated, activities involved, and more.

<p><strong>Medical drug names.</strong> To build their <a

Drug Dictionary</a>, <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921009768">Mohammad
A. Khaleel et al.</a> collected trade names and ingredient names “from
open access websites belonging to official drug regulatory agencies,
official healthcare systems, or recognized scientific bodies from 44
countries around the world,” among other sources. Each of the 450,000+
entries maps a name to standardized ingredient information from the
National Library of Medicine’s <a
href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html">RxNorm</a>
database.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Foundation shades.</strong> For “<a
href="https://pudding.cool/2021/03/foundation-names/">The Naked
Truth</a>,” a Pudding article published last year with <a
href="https://ofunneamaka.com/about-ofunneamaka/">Ofunne Amaka</a>, <a
href="https://amber.rbind.io/">Amber Thomas</a> scraped <a
href="https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/foundation-names">information
about 6,800+ foundation shades</a> from the websites of two major
cosmetics retailers. The project’s datasets identify each product’s
name, description, URL, and the predominant <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB</a>/<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">HSL</a> color value in
its swatch image.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Honey bees.</strong> Since the 1980s, the US Department of
Agriculture has <a
href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Bee_and_Honey/">conducted</a>
an annual <a
href="https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/hd76s004z?locale=en">Bee
and Honey Inquiry Survey</a>, which generates estimates of “the number
of colonies producing honey, yield per colony, honey production, average
price, price by color class and value as well as honey stocks at the
state and national levels.” Since 2016, it has also published <a
href="https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/rn301137d?locale=en">annual
reports that examine the gain and loss of colonies</a>, including losses
due to <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/oc/br/ccd/index/">colony
collapse disorder</a>.</p>
