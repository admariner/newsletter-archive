<p><strong>Municipal zoning rules.</strong> <a
href="https://mattmleczko.scholar.princeton.edu/">Matt Mleczko</a> and
<a href="https://matthewdesmond.scholar.princeton.edu/">Matthew
Desmond</a>, of Princeton’s <a href="https://evictionlab.org/">Eviction
Lab</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-04-18-edition/">DIP
2018.04.18</a>), have <a
href="https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/2YGAQ9JE5S6PYXHVTBZG/full">developed
a method</a> for extracting structured information from the text of
local zoning regulations. Their <a
href="https://github.com/mtmleczko/nzlud">National Zoning and Land Use
Database</a> covers 2,600+ cities, towns, and other municipalities — a
sample drawn from the <a
href="https://real-faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/gyourko/land-use-survey/">Wharton
Residential Land Use Regulatory Index</a>’s prior, survey-based
research. The database includes dozens of indicators, such as whether
the rules specify annual limits on several types of permits, allow any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_suite">accessory
dwelling units</a>, require various review-board approvals, impose
parking space minimums, and more. These factors then feed into the
authors’ <a
href="https://evictionlab.org/zoning-restrictiveness-index/">Zoning
Restrictiveness Index</a>, which they calculate at a municipal and
metro-area level.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>AI incidents.</strong> The <a
href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/">AI Incident Database</a> “is
dedicated to indexing the collective history of harms or near harms
realized in the real world by the deployment of artificial intelligence
systems.” The <a
href="https://github.com/responsible-ai-collaborative/aiid">open-source</a>
project is “<a href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/about/">managed in a
participatory manner</a>,” with a board of directors, submissions from
the public, and a team of reviewers guided by a <a
href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/editors-guide/">set of definitions and
decision criteria</a>. So far, it has cataloged 500+ incidents and
2,500+ reports, which you can <a
href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/apps/discover/">search and filter</a>
by <a href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/entities/">entity</a>, <a
href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/taxonomies/">category</a>, date, and
other facets. You can also <a

snapshots of the database</a>. [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>State bill trajectories.</strong> Political scientist <a
href="https://www.alexgarlick.com/">Alex Garlick</a> has published a <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/8PTHXT">dataset
categorizing bills’ trajectories in state legislatures</a>. It follows
each proposed law’s journey along 23 possible steps, which range from
“First Reading (first chamber)” to “Bill enacted.” The dataset spans
more than 1 million bills tracked by <a
href="https://openstates.org/">OpenStates</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-09-30-edition/">DIP
2020.09.30</a>), with full coverage for all 50 states for 2011–18 and
partial coverage for some earlier and later years. <strong>Read

using this data.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rare-earth mining.</strong> <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136823001439">Shuang-Liang
Liu et al.</a> have compiled a <a

of 146 mining projects targeting <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_element">rare-earth
elements</a>, which serve as “critical raw materials in many low-carbon
technologies.” The dataset lists each project’s name, company, location,
status, deposit type, estimated tonnage of deposits, element
composition, and other details sourced from “company annual reports and
public presentations, government reports, and papers in various
scientific journals.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“Pirate radio” enforcement.</strong> The Federal
Communications Commission <a
href="https://www.fcc.gov/pirate-database">publishes</a> a <a
href="https://opendata.fcc.gov/stories/s/wgq8-eb5c">dashboard</a> and <a
href="https://opendata.fcc.gov/Pirate-Radio-Enforcement/Pirate-Radio-Broadcasting-Database/xqgr-24et">dataset</a>
of its “pirate radio” enforcement actions, part of the agency’s <a

against</a> the “unauthorized transmission of radio frequency signals on
the frequencies in or adjacent to the FM and AM radio bands.” The 38
entries list the entity targeted, state/territory, radio frequency,
enforcement type, date issued, and penalty amount. They go back to early
2020, when Congress passed the <a

<p> </p>
<p><em>🎤 In case you missed last week’s announcement: I’ve launched a
<a href="https://podcast.data-is-plural.com/">Data Is Plural
podcast</a>, and it’s <a

where I’ll be sharing screenshots and other multimedia bits that don’t

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Treasury transactions.</strong> The US Treasury’s <a
href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/daily-treasury-statement/operating-cash-balance">Daily
Treasury Statement dataset</a> paints a near-real-time picture of the
federal government’s purse. The eight tables provide data on “operating
cash balance, deposits and withdrawals of cash, public debt
transactions, federal tax deposits, income tax refunds issued,” and
more. The table of deposits and withdrawals, for example, indicates the
total value (rounded to the nearest $1 million) of transactions each
day, by type and category (e.g., “Economic Recovery Programs,” “Defense
Vendor Payments,” etc.). The records, available to download in bulk or
<a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/api-documentation/">via
API</a>, go back to October 2005. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a
href="https://qz.com/can-a-billionaire-die-without-anyone-noticing-1850268606">Can
a billionaire die without anyone noticing? The mystery behind a
remarkable $7 billion tax payment.</a>” (<a

Hickey</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>European buildings.</strong> <a
href="https://eubucco.com/">EUBUCCO</a> is a “database of individual
building footprints for 200+ million buildings across the 27 European
Union countries and Switzerland, together with three main attributes –
building type, height and construction year – included for respectively
45%, 74%, 24% of the buildings.” The researchers, who describe their
methodology in a <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02040-2">recent
paper</a>, collected and standardized the information from 50 open
government datasets and OpenStreetMap. They then “perform[ed] extensive
validation analyses to assess the quality, consistency and completeness
of the data in every country.” You can <a
href="https://eubucco.com/data/map">browse the data online</a>, <a
href="https://eubucco.com/data/">download it</a>, and <a
href="https://github.com/ai4up/eubucco">access the underlying
code</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>911 service areas.</strong> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_safety_answering_point">Public
Safety Answering Points</a> (PSAPs) are, essentially, the call centers
to which 911 calls are routed. A while ago, the US government hired a
contractor to compile a <a
href="https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/geoplatform::psap-911-service-area-boundaries/explore">dataset
of the service area boundaries</a> for each of the country’s PSAPs, “the
geographic area within which a 911 call placed using a landline is
answered at the associated PSAP.” Although some of that information has
likely changed since the dataset’s publication in 2009, the records may
still be useful for certain purposes. <strong>Related</strong>: The
FCC’s <a
href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/9-1-1-master-psap-registry">911 Master
PSAP Registry</a>, which doesn’t include service boundaries but does
provide the name, state, county, and ID of 6,000+ primary PSAPs, plus
2,700+ PSAPs listed as “secondary,” “duplicate,” or “orphaned.” [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lists of medical codes.</strong> <a
href="https://www.opencodelists.org/">OpenCodelists</a> is “an open
platform for creating and sharing codelists of clinical terms and
drugs,” built by the University of Oxford’s <a
href="https://www.opensafely.org/">OpenSAFELY</a> team. The platform <a
href="https://www.opencodelists.org/docs/">supports</a> several coding
systems, including <a

<p><strong>Midwestern mollusks.</strong> The <a

History Survey</a>’s <a
href="https://mollusk.inhs.illinois.edu/">mollusk collection</a>
contains 500,000+ specimens, cataloged into 90,000+ lots, some gathered
more than a century ago. “The collection is strong in freshwater mussels
(Unionoida), freshwater and terrestrial snails from the Midwestern U.S.
and cone shells (Conoidea),” as well as “freshwater bivalves and
gastropods from the Southeastern U.S., Central, and South America.” For
each lot, the <a

<p><strong>Health workers.</strong> The World Health Organization’s <a

estimates of the number of medical doctors, nursing and midwifery

health personnel. The estimates come from the WHO’s <a

Health Workforce Accounts system</a>, national censuses, labor force
surveys, and other sources. For medical doctors, the estimates span
nearly 200 countries, with the majority having estimates as recent as
2020 or 2021. Twenty countries’ estimates go back to the 1960s (and, for
Spain, all the way back to 1952). [h/t <a

a <a href="https://ukraine.bellingcat.com/">map and dataset of 1,000+
incidents</a> “that have resulted in potential civilian impact or harm
since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.” They include incidents
“where rockets or missiles struck civilian areas,” “where attacks have
resulted in the destruction of civilian infrastructure,” and/or where
visual evidence depicts civilian injuries or “immobile civilian bodies.”
The information, <a

rather place each geographic unit into one of ten ranges. The income

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Congressional votes and ideology.</strong> The <a
href="https://voteview.com/">Voteview</a> project “allows users to view
every congressional roll call vote in American history,” and places
those votes in the <a href="https://voteview.com/about">context of
ideology estimates along a liberal-to-conservative spectrum</a>. The
core estimates come from <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method)">DW-NOMINATE</a>,
a method developed by the project’s directors emeritus, <a
href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/83232/">Keith T. Poole and
Howard Rosenthal</a>. Voteview’s <a
href="https://voteview.com/data">bulk data</a> includes <a
href="https://voteview.com/articles/data_help_members">ideology
estimates for every member</a> of the House and Senate since 1789, <a
href="https://voteview.com/articles/data_help_rollcalls">every vote
taken in either chamber</a>, and <a

position on those votes</a>. [h/t <a

<p><strong>EPA-regulated facilities.</strong> The US Environmental
Protection Agency’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/frs">Facility Registry
System</a> “provides Internet access to a single source of comprehensive
information about facilities, sites or places subject to environmental
regulations or of environmental interest.” It includes each entity’s
name, type, location, industry, regulatory programs, and more. That
information, which spans millions of facilities, is “subjected to
rigorous verification and data management quality assurance procedures.”
The records also provide facilities’ ID numbers from other EPA systems,
such as the agency’s <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/epa-risk-management-program-database/">Risk
Management Program database</a> featured in <a

concepts</a>. Its <a

provide information on the languages’ years announced, <a

<p><strong>20th-century occupations.</strong> Between 1939 and 1991, the
US government published several iterations of the now-discontinued <a
href="https://www.oalj.dol.gov/PUBLIC/DOT/REFERENCES/DOTINTRO.HTM">Dictionary
of Occupational Titles</a>, a precursor to the <a
href="https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html">O*NET database</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-09-27-edition/">DIP
2017.09.27</a>). The dictionaries included job descriptions,
classification codes, and cross-references, but are mostly available
only as scans. So <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07073">Shahad
Althobaiti et al.</a> organized the manual transcription of five major
editions into <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DQW8IP">structured
text files</a>. A random sample of 1939’s titles: punch-press operator,
seam dampener, base brander, box pleater, and necktie finisher.</p>

<p><strong>Thump, thump, coconut.</strong> “Traditionally,” in the
Philippines, “coconuts are classified into their maturity levels
manually,” <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340923000549">June
Anne Caladcad and Eduardo Piedad Jr. write</a>. “Traders often use their
fingernails, knuckles, or the blunt end of the knife to tap the coconuts
before assessing the sounds produced.” The authors <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168169919324767">and
their colleagues</a> have developed hardware and software to emulate
that process, and used it to collect <a

data</a> from 129 premature, mature, and overmature coconuts, each
mechanically knocked on each of its three ridges.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Facilities handling hazardous chemicals, Animal Welfare Act
inspections, daily European gas imports, unclaimed estates, and data
journalists.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Facilities handling hazardous chemicals.</strong> The US
Environmental Protection Agency’s <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/rmp/risk-management-program-rmp-rule-overview">Risk
Management Program rule</a> requires facilities that handle “extremely
hazardous substances” to tell the government, at least every five years,
about those substances, their safety plans, their recent accident
history, and more. Through a <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/epa-risk-management-program/">FOIA
request to the EPA</a>, the <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation
Project</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/about/">which, disclosure,
I run</a>) obtained a copy of the agency’s database of these filings
(minus some parts the government deems non-disclosable), containing
submissions by 21,000+ facilities from early 1999 to February 2022. You
can now <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/epa-risk-management-program-database/">access
that data</a>, in various formats, along with <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jrLXtv0knnACiPXJ1ZRFXR1GaPWCHJWWjin4rsthFbQ/edit">documentation
guiding you through it</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Animal Welfare Act inspections.</strong> The USDA’s <a
href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/">Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service</a> checks whether animal dealers, exhibitors,
research facilities, and transporters are complying with the care
standards set by the <a
href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalwelfare/awa/ct_awa_program_information">Animal
Welfare Act</a>. The agency provides <a
href="https://efile.aphis.usda.gov/PublicSearchTool/s/inspection-reports">public
access to the inspection reports</a> but no bulk data on them. So, in a
<a
href="https://biglocalnews.org/content/news/2023/02/21/usda-animal-inspection-database.html">collaboration</a>
between <a href="https://biglocalnews.org/content/about/">Big Local
News</a> and the <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data
Liberation Project</a> (same disclosure as above), <a
href="https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/">Ben Welsh</a> and I <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/aphis-inspection-reports/blob/main/METHODOLOGY.md">wrote
code</a> to fetch the 80,000+ (and counting) inspections going back to
2014, parse their PDFs, and <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/aphis-inspection-reports">make
the data more accessible</a>. The information includes each inspection’s
date, type, licensee, violation counts, species inspected, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Daily European gas imports.</strong> Researchers at <a
href="https://www.bruegel.org/bruegel-european-think-tank-specialises-economics">Bruegel</a>
are <a
href="https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/european-natural-gas-imports">tracking
daily and weekly natural gas imports to Europe</a>, using data from the
<a href="https://www.entsog.eu/">European Network of Transmission System
Operators for Gas</a>’s <a
href="https://transparency.entsog.eu/">transparency portal</a>.
Alongside the imports, which they’re aggregating by source (e.g.,
Russia, Norway, Algeria) and by route (e.g., Nord Stream, TurkStream),
the researchers are also tracking <a href="https://agsi.gie.eu/">gas
storage levels</a>, using data from <a href="https://www.gie.eu/">Gas
Infrastructure Europe</a> (<a

<p><strong>Unclaimed estates.</strong> The UK government’s <a
href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/bona-vacantia">Bona
Vacantia division</a> publishes a <a
href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/unclaimed-estates-list">dataset
of unclaimed estates</a> — inheritances that nobody has claimed yet to
inherit. The entries indicate the deceased person’s name, aliases,
date/place of birth and death, marital status, and more.
<strong>Related</strong>: California provides a <a

holdings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Data journalists, surveyed.</strong> The <a
href="https://ejc.net/">European Journalism Center</a>’s <a

a <a href="https://github.com/ejcnet/stateofdatajournalism2022">dataset
of 1,800+ anonymized responses</a> to its <a

Data Journalism Survey</a>, including 50+ entries each from the US, UK,
Italy, Germany, Spain, India, and Nigeria, plus double-digit counts from
dozens of other countries. The questions touch on demographics,
employment, training, skills, the COVID-19 pandemic, and more. [h/t <a

<p><em>👋 Free workshop! I’m teaching a PDF-parsing class at <a
href="https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/nicar-2023/">NICAR
2023</a> in a couple of weeks. I’d like to test out the material by
teaching it online first. If you’re interested (and have some experience
with Python), <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Fair market rents.</strong> Every year, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development recalculates what it calls “fair market
rents” <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html">for
every county in the US</a> and <a
href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr/smallarea/index.html">for
individual ZIP codes in metropolitan counties</a>. The results, which
factor into various housing subsidy programs, <a
href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/24/888.113">represent</a> the
40th percentile cost of monthly rent and (basic) utilities for “recent
movers” in “standard quality” units, adjusted for the number of
bedrooms. HUD’s annual spreadsheets go back to the early 2000s; you can
also browse the estimates online and <a
href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/dataset/fmr-api.html">query them
via an API</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a
