      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Disasters, nursing-home staffing, Brazil’s vaccination registry, probable news quotations, and British millionaires of the late 1920s.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Disasters.</strong> The <a href="https://www.emdat.be/">Emergency Events Database</a> (EM-DAT) contains “essential core data on the occurrence and effects of more than 21,000 [natural and technological] disasters in the world, from 1900 to present.” It <a href="https://www.emdat.be/explanatory-notes">focuses on</a> disasters that have caused 10+ human deaths, affected 100+ people, sparked a state of emergency, and/or prompted a request for international assistance. Where known, the <a href="https://public.emdat.be/">public dataset</a> (registration required) indicates each disaster’s location, type, start/end dates, and estimated damages; the number of people killed, injured, made homeless, or otherwise affected; and more. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/pend-gdis-1960-2018">The Geocoded Disasters (GDIS) Dataset</a> (registration required) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00846-6">provides spatial coordinates</a> for the natural disasters in EM-DAT from 1960 to 2018.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nursing-home staffing.</strong> The US Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services requires nursing homes to submit <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/NursingHomeQualityInits/Staffing-Data-Submission-PBJ">detailed payroll information</a>, which the agency converts into <a href="https://data.cms.gov/browse?q=daily+nurse+staffing">public-use files</a> that <a href="https://data.cms.gov/Special-Programs-Initiatives-Long-Term-Care-Facili/PBJ-Public-Use-Files-Data-Documentation/ygny-gzks">summarize</a> daily staffing levels at each facility. The files count employee and contract hours for dozens of types of staff, ranging from administrators to respiratory therapists. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/business/nursing-homes-ratings-medicare-covid.html">Maggots, Rape and Yet Five Stars: How U.S. Ratings of Nursing Homes Mislead the Public</a>,” a recent New York Times investigation that uses the data in several ways.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Brazil’s vaccination registry.</strong> Brazil’s health ministry is publishing <a href="https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/en/dataset/covid-19-vacinacao">granular data from its COVID-19 vaccination registry</a>, with data on more than 12 million doses administered so far. For each dose, it indicates the patient’s date of birth, sex, race, location, and eligibility group; the vaccine name, manufacturer, and lot; the date and location of vaccination; and more. [h/t <a href="https://dataisthenewoil.substack.com/p/data-is-the-new-oil-18022021-update">Olivier Lejeune</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Probable news quotations.</strong> <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4277311">Quotebank</a> is “an open corpus of 178 million quotations attributed to the speakers who uttered them, extracted from 162 million English news articles published between 2008 and 2020.” Its authors <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437963.3441760">used machine learning</a> to identify the quotes and speakers, “correctly [attributing] 86.9% of quotations in our experiments.” The five most-quoted people: Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton, and Narendra Modi. [h/t <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:arnicas/">Lynn Cherny</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Early British millionaires.</strong> Business historian <a href="https://www.henley.ac.uk/people/professor-peter-scott">Peter Scott</a> has <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ehr.13025">reconstructed a dataset</a> of Britain’s “<a href="https://ehs.org.uk/britains-inter-war-super-rich-the-1928-9-millionaire-list-2/">inter-war super-rich</a>.” Scott started with an official (but mostly nameless) list of 438 “millionaires” (which tax authorities defined as people with annual incomes above £50,000) from 1928/29, and then cross-referenced the entries with other sources to identify 291 men and 28 women who fit the criteria.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Police misconduct settlements, congressional e-newsletters, California vaccine availability, illegal cheetah commerce, and soil.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Police misconduct settlements.</strong> Reporters at FiveThirtyEight and The Marshall Project filed freedom-of-information requests to 50 US cities, asking for data on all civil lawsuits against their police departments/officers “that resulted in a monetary legal settlement” in 2010–2019 — including incident and settlement dates, plaintiff and defendant names, allegation descriptions, amounts awarded, and more. They received <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/police-settlements">full or partial data from 31 of those cities</a>, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends/">found that</a> total payouts <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/02/22/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-that-s-where-the-accountability-ends">exceeded $3 billion</a>. <strong>Don’t miss</strong>: The data repository’s “<a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/police-settlements#words-of-caution">words of caution</a>,” which discourage comparisons between cities. <strong>Related</strong>: Coauthor Laura Bronner’s <a href="https://twitter.com/laurabronner/status/1363961281905106956">introductory Twitter thread</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Congressional e-newsletters.</strong> <a href="https://www.dcinbox.com/about">For more than a decade</a>, political scientist <a href="https://www.lindseycormack.com/">Lindsey Cormack</a>’s <a href="https://www.dcinbox.com/">DCinbox</a> project has collected “every official e-newsletter sent by sitting members of the U.S. House and Senate.” You can search the corpus online and also <a href="https://www.lindseycormack.com/dcinbox-data-downloads">download all the emails</a> as a series of CSV files, grouped by month. For each of the 130,000+ mailings, the files provide the date, subject, body, and sender’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/member-bioguide-ids">Bioguide</a> ID. (April 2020 was the highest-volume month, with more than 2,300 messages, nearly all of them mentioning the coronavirus.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>California vaccine availability.</strong> The volunteer-driven <a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/">VaccinateCA</a> project calls “hundreds of potential [COVID-19] vaccination sites daily, asking them if they have the vaccine and if so to whom they will administer it to and how to get an appointment.” You can examine the results on their website, and also use <a href="https://docs.vaccinateca.com/reference">their API</a> to access the latest data, which includes status reports on every California county, 20+ health care providers, and thousands of potential vaccination sites. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://blog.vaccinateca.com/what-weve-learned-so-far/">What We’ve Learned (So Far)</a>.” [h/t <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/28/vaccinateca/">Simon Willison</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Illegal cheetah commerce.</strong> A team of conservationists <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921001323">has compiled</a> a <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/84k92j4n3y">decade of data on illegal cheetah sales and ownership</a>, drawing from “over 300 sources, including direct communications with field informants, veterinarians, and cheetah owners,” court records, social media, and more. The dataset covers 1,800+ cases — including both actual seizures and alleged/suspected incidents — involving 4,000+ cheetahs or cheetah parts/derivatives.</p>

<p><strong>Indian court cases.</strong> The <a href="http://www.devdatalab.org/">Development Data Lab</a> has gathered <a href="http://www.devdatalab.org/judicial-bias-data">data on 81.2 million court cases</a> in India’s lower judiciary between 2010 and 2018, drawn from the country’s <a href="https://districts.ecourts.gov.in/">e-Courts platform</a>. It’s “the largest open-access dataset on judicial proceedings in the world,” <a href="https://devdatalab.medium.com/big-data-for-justice-f53e0e14c9c9">says project coauthor Aditi Bhowmick</a>. The public dataset contains each case’s state, district, court, case type, filing and decision dates, defendant and petitioner genders, legal codes, and more. It “has been fully anonymized to prevent the identification of individual judges or litigants,” but researchers can apply for more extensive access.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Private prisons, detailed elevations, even more mortality data, web trackers, and hockey.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Private prisons.</strong> Political scientist <a href="https://www.annagunderson.com/home">Anna Gunderson</a> has <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/why-do-states-privatize-their-prisons-the-unintended-consequences-of-inmate-litigation/AF814E16A605CA894D558AE72BEF65C9">assembled</a> a <a href="https://www.annagunderson.com/data/private-prisons">longitudinal dataset of private prisons</a> at the federal, state, and local level through 2016. Using decades of financial reports by the two largest operators, plus those by two other companies one later acquired, Gunderson’s dataset identifies each facility’s name, location, primary customer, capacity, security level, contract information, and more. <strong>Related</strong>: Last week, President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/executive-order-reforming-our-incarceration-system-to-eliminate-the-use-of-privately-operated-criminal-detention-facilities/">signed an executive order</a> to phase out the federal use of such facilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Detailed elevations.</strong> Among <a href="https://opentopography.org/about">its goals</a>, <a href="https://opentopography.org/">OpenTopography</a> wants to “democratize online access to high-resolution (meter to sub-meter scale), Earth science-oriented, topography data acquired with lidar and other technologies.” The project hosts <a href="https://portal.opentopography.org/dataCatalog">hundreds of elevation datasets</a> from <a href="https://portal.opentopography.org/datasets">around the world</a>, available to visualize online and to download. <strong>Related</strong>: The US Geological Survey’s <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep/what-is-3dep">3D Elevation Program</a> aims “to provide the first-ever national baseline of consistent high-resolution topographic elevation data” by 2023, and already publishes <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep/data-tools">a range of subnational datasets</a>.

<p><strong>Even more mortality data.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality">World Mortality Dataset</a> contains recent “all-cause mortality” counts for 79 countries, aggregated to weekly, monthly, or quarterly totals (depending on availability). Launched last week by researchers <a href="https://akarlinsky.github.io/">Ariel Karlinsky</a> and <a href="https://dkobak.github.io/">Dmitry Kobak</a>, the project draws on the <a href="https://www.mortality.org/">Human Mortality Database</a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Weekly_death_statistics&amp;stable">EuroStat</a>, and data <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/excess-deaths">collected by the New York Times</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-05-27-edition">DIP 2020.05.27</a>); and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250604v1">expands upon it</a> by gathering data from government websites and through direct inquiries.

<p><strong>Tens of millions of flights.</strong> The <a href="https://opensky-network.org">OpenSky Network</a> crowdsources air traffic data, thanks to members who collect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast">radio signals that aircraft periodically broadcast</a>. The nonprofit organization has published a “<a href="https://opensky-network.org/community/blog/item/6-opensky-covid-19-flight-dataset">COVID-19 flight dataset</a>,” which contains <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4419082">metadata for the tens of millions of flights</a> those members observed in 2019 and 2020, with plans to update the dataset until the pandemic ends. It includes each flight’s call sign, aircraft model type, origin and destination airports, time first and last seen, and more.

      <description>Electoral attitudes, fishing activity, Bundestag writings, innovation licensing, and chess puzzles.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Electoral attitudes, fishing activity, Bundestag writings, innovation licensing, and chess puzzles.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Electoral attitudes.</strong> The <a href="https://u.osu.edu/cnep/">Comparative National Elections Project</a> “is a partnership among scholars who have conducted election surveys on five continents,” with a focus on understanding the factors that shape voters’ decisions. The project’s <a href="https://u.osu.edu/cnep/surveys/surveys-through-2012/">publicly-available datasets</a> include 48 of the surveys, which use a combination of country-specific questions and <a href="https://u.osu.edu/cnep/common-core-questionnaire/">shared questionnaire</a> — asking about political news consumption, attitudes towards democracy, interpersonal communications, and other topics. <strong>Related</strong>: The <a href="https://cses.org/">Comparative Study of Electoral Systems</a>, a similar collaboration with “a special emphasis on voting and turnout.” [h/t <a href="https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData/commit/26ff4d1932024d71b29a1195597d5e5a64367cca">Erik Gahner Larsen</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Fishing activity.</strong> <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/">Global Fishing Watch</a> — initially organized as <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/about-us/">a collaboration</a> between conservationists and Google — uses satellite imagery, ship signals, and other sources “to visualise, track and share data about global fishing activity in near real-time and for free.” The project’s <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/">public datasets</a> (free registration required) examine various aspects of the industry, including the <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/fishing-effort/">geography of “fishing effort”</a> (2012–16) and <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/transshipment-success/report-first-global-view-transshipment-sea/">transshipment between vessels</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-brexit-eu-fisheries/">Why the U.K. and EU Are Fighting Over Fish</a>” (Bloomberg). [h/t <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2020/12/21/who-catches-the-most-fish/">Nathan Yau</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bundestag writings.</strong> Political scientists <a href="https://corinna-kroeber.jimdofree.com/">Corinna Kroeber</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tremsch">Tobias Remschel</a> have <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/government-and-opposition/article/every-single-word-a-new-data-set-including-all-parliamentary-materials-published-in-germany/34D424C406687F7446C6F32980A4FE84">compiled</a> a <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/7EJ1KI">dataset</a> of “all written communication published by the German Bundestag between 1949 and 2017,” unifying <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/services/opendata">datasets released by Germany’s parliament</a> “in a manner easily accessible to researchers applying text analysis.” For each of the 131,835 reports, requests, bills, and other documents, the dataset provides the full text, date, author information, and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/L4OAKN">Six million parliamentary speeches from nine countries</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-04-29-edition">DIP 2020.04.29</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Innovation licensing.</strong> Government agencies often commercialize their innovations through “<a href="https://federallabs.org/learning-center/what-is-t2">technology transfer</a>” programs, which strike collaboration and licensing agreements with outside parties. NASA provides a <a href="https://technology.nasa.gov/api/">technology transfer API</a> for accessing data about its patent portfolio and software catalog; the National Institutes of Health offers a <a href="https://www.ott.nih.gov/nih-ott-api">similar API</a> for querying its licensing opportunities.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Chess puzzles.</strong> <a href="https://lichess.org/about">Lichess</a> is a free, open-source, donation-supported chess server. Its team publishes a <a href="https://database.lichess.org/">database of the rated matches</a> played on its platform (more than 1.7 billion so far, since 2013), which it recently used <a href="https://lichess.org/blog/X-S6gRUAAGjNX4ki/new-puzzles-are-here">to revamp</a> its <a href="https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles">dataset of original chess puzzles</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="http://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html">Chess games from high-level players and tournaments</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-02-17-edition">DIP 2016.02.17</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Megascale coronavirus surveys.</strong> Carnegie Mellon University’s <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/about/">epidemiological forecasting group</a> and Facebook have partnered to field a <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/surveys/">large-scale coronavirus survey in the US</a>; they’ve collected <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/">more than 15 million responses since April 2020</a>. The University of Maryland has <a href="https://covidmap.umd.edu/">formed a similar partnership</a> for an international survey, in which “a representative sample of Facebook users is invited on a daily basis to report on symptoms, social distancing behavior, mental health issues, and financial constraints”; <a href="https://ischool.umd.edu/news/university-maryland-carnegie-mellon-and-facebook-team-forecast-coronavirus-spread">millions have also participated</a>. Geographically-aggregated results of the US survey can be downloaded via an <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/export/">online interface</a> or <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html">Delphi’s API</a>; the international results are also <a href="https://covidmap.umd.edu/api.html">available via API</a>. <strong>Practical example</strong>: <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2020/12/13/are-masks-widely-used-in-public/">An analysis of state-by-state mask usage, with code</a>.

<p><strong>Commodity-transportation costs.</strong> The UN and the World Bank have <a href="https://unctad.org/news/why-and-how-measure-international-transport-costs">launched</a> a new <a href="https://unctadstat.unctad.org/EN/TransportCost.html">interactive map</a> and <a href="https://unctadstat.unctad.org/wds/ReportFolders/reportFolders.aspx?IF_ActivePath=P%2C207045">dataset</a> that quantify the transportation costs for international trade — country-by-country and broken down by mode of transportation (sea, air, rail, road), trading partner, and commodity. The numbers, based both on directly-reported figures and statistical modelling, include costs overall, per unit, and per unit per kilometer. The project currently covers only 2016, but has plans to expand. [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/JanHoffmann_gva/status/1341414753567186947">Jan Hoffmann</a>]</p>

<p><strong>More college sports financing.</strong> The <a href="http://cafidatabase.knightcommission.org">College Athletics Financial Information Database</a>, run by the privately-funded <a href="https://www.knightcommission.org">Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics</a>, details the annual sources of revenue (such as ticket sales) and expenses (such as coaches’ compensation) for hundreds of schools, based on information self-reported to the NCAA and federal government. Many of the records <a href="http://cafidatabase.knightcommission.org/about-the-data">were obtained</a> via freedom-of-information requests by <a href="https://sports.usatoday.com/2020/07/05/methodology-for-2019-ncaa-athletic-department-revenue-database/">USA Today and Syracuse University students</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Millions of computational notebooks.</strong> In 2017, a team of researchers <a href="https://github.com/activityhistory/jupyter_on_github">downloaded and analyzed</a> 1.25 million publicly-available Jupyter notebooks — <a href="https://jupyter.org/">documents</a> that weave computational code, output, and text. They also <a href="https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb6931851t">published</a> the notebooks and their related metadata. Inspired by that project, a team at JetBrains recently did a follow-up scan, <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/datalore/2020/12/17/we-downloaded-10-000-000-jupyter-notebooks-from-github-this-is-what-we-learned/">analyzing and publishing data on nearly 10 million notebooks</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2020 in haiku.</strong> Over the course of 2020, <a href="https://twitter.com/elibryan">Eli Holder</a> paid workers on Mechanical Turk to turn news headlines into 5/7/5-syllable poems. The result: 2,760 “Doom Haikus,” which you can <a href="https://doomhaikus.3iap.co/">browse on a timeline</a> or <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/newshaikus/dataset">download in bulk</a>. For each poem, the dataset also includes the original article URL, date processed, headline, and SEO snippet. [h/t <a href="http://ksaj.inlisp.org">Karsten Johansson</a>]</p>
