<p><strong>Opioid settlement payouts.</strong> KFF Health News <a
href="https://kffhealthnews.org/opioid-settlements/">has been
following</a> the slew of legal settlements by companies accused of
exacerbating the opioid crisis. Last week, they published an <a
href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/opioid-settlement-payouts-state-county-city-tracker/">interactive</a>
and <a
href="https://kffhealthnews.org/download-the-data-opioid-settlement-payouts/">downloadable</a>
database of payouts to state and local governments so far (and expected
in the future) from the largest national settlement, “a $26 billion deal
with four companies that will be paid out over nearly two decades.” The
data, <a
href="https://www.nationalopioidofficialsettlement.com/Home/StateAllocationAmounts">gathered
from the court-appointed firm administering the settlement</a>, include
overall numbers for 48 states and DC, plus locality-level data for 35
states. (Los Angeles County, for instance, received $47 million in 2022
and 2023, with another $210 million expected in years to come.)

Pattani</a> “will discuss the data and how it can help you launch into
coverage of the historic opioid settlement story.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Groundwater wells.</strong> Despite the infrastructural
importance of groundwater wells, “a unified database collecting and
standardizing information on the characteristics and locations of these
wells across the United States has been lacking,” <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03186-3">Chung-Yi Lin
et al.</a> write. “To bridge this gap, we have created a comprehensive
database of groundwater well records collected from state and federal
agencies.” Their <a
href="https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/8b02895f02c14dd1a749bcc5584a5c55/">United
States Groundwater Well Database</a> contains ~14 million records, each
indicating a well equipped for monitoring or extracting water. Where
available, each row lists the well’s coordinates, county, aquifer,
watershed, depth, capacity, water use category, water potability, and
more. [h/t <a href="http://knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/">Derek M. Jones</a>]</p>

Work-Injury Policy Database</a> tracks the history of work-injury laws
(also known as workers’ compensation laws) in 186 “independent nation
states.” For each, the database lists the year of its first such law,
the year a law first provided insurance for work-related injuries, the
type of program it established, and more. It also incorporates data on
current laws’ coverage and payment rates from <a

Dates Dataset</a>, <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/apvqm">compiled
by</a> political scientist <a
href="https://www.beckerbastian.net/">Bastian Becker</a>, “aggregates
information on the reach and duration of European colonial empires from
renowned secondary sources.” Producing the dataset from its four main
sources “is largely automated, relying on predefined coding rules.” The
dataset indicates the first and last years each contemporary country was
colonized, disaggregated by eight colonizing countries (Belgium,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain). [h/t

<p><strong>Power outages.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03095-5">Christa
Brelsford et al.</a> have compiled a <a
href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/The_Environment_for_Analysis_of_Geo-Located_Energy_Information_s_Recorded_Electricity_Outages_2014-2022/24237376">county-level
estimates of the number of US customers experiencing power outages</a>
at 15-minute intervals from 2014 to 2023. The records come from <a

Ridge National Laboratory</a>’s restricted-access <a
href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/articles/doe-announces-transition-eagle-i-oak-ridge-national-laboratory-ornl-taking-advantage">Environment
for Analysis of Geo-Located Energy Information</a>, a “platform created
to monitor electric utility customer outages from data gathered from
public sources.” The data’s coverage has increased over time; by 2022,
it represented 92% of customers in the 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico.
“The remaining 8% of customers belong to utilities which do not report
outage information publicly in near-real time in a format that is
currently accessible to EAGLE-I parsers,” the authors write. “These are
most typically small, rural, municipal utilities which lack robust
information technology infrastructure.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>European Parliament activity.</strong> <a

and prior members of the European Parliament, 23,000+ policy dossiers,
39,000+ votes, and much more. The project, launched in 2011, scrapes

<p><strong>Institutional investments.</strong> If you’re an
institutional investor with US operations and managing at least $100
million in publicly traded securities, the Securities and Exchange
Commission requires you to file <a
href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/form-13f-reports-filed-institutional-investment">Form
13F</a> each quarter. (The biggest filers — such as Vanguard, BlackRock,
and State Street — have trillions of dollars invested.) These filings,
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/form-13f">available to download
going back to mid-2013</a>, detail each investor’s long positions for
each security: their number of shares, market value, security type,
issuer name, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUSIP">CUSIP
code</a>, and more. <strong>As seen in</strong>: Michigan teenager <a

<p><strong>Human development, indexed.</strong> Perhaps the best-known
metric of its kind, the United Nations’ <a
href="https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index">Human
Development Index</a> combines statistics on life expectancy, income per
capita, and years of schooling into a single number for each
country-year. The UN provides <a

and an <a href="https://api.hdrdata.org/swagger/index.html">API</a> for
all annual HDI ratings and sub-components for 1990 to 2022. Those

<p><strong>Extrajudicial killings in Bangladesh.</strong> Between 2009
and 2022, “Bangladesh’s security forces killed at least 2,597 people in
apparent extrajudicial executions, custodial torture, and by firing
bullets at protesters,” according to <a
href="https://nazmulahasan.com/">Nazmul Ahasan</a>’s <a
href="https://interactive.netra.news/extrajudicial-killings-bangladesh/">analysis
for Netra News</a>, building on data “compiled by Bangladeshi human
rights defenders and collated by the Australia-based <a
href="https://www.cpjp.org.au/resources/bangladesh">Capital Punishment
Justice Project</a>.” Ahasan and colleagues “independently verified more
than 98% of the cases in the dataset using press reports and
subsequently updated any incomplete data.” The records are available as
a table in the article and <a
href="https://interactive.netra.news/extrajudicial-killings-bangladesh/data.json">as

<p><strong>Rolling Stone’s album rankings.</strong> A <a

from The Pudding</a> compares <em>Rolling Stone</em>’s “500 Greatest
Albums of All Time” lists from 2003, 2012, and 2020. A methodology note
says the project began with a <a

Research, converts anonymized case records into “a new dataset in which
records do not correspond to actual individuals, but which preserves the
structure and statistics (i.e., utility) of the original data.” Each row
indicates a (synthetic) individual’s gender, age group, citizenship,
country of exploitation, duration of reported trafficking, traffickers’
means of control, types of exploitation, and the year the <a

58,000+ decisions in 24,000+ cases, going back to the late 1980s. (To
download the full database, conduct a blank search and then click the
“Export to Excel” link.) Each entry lists a decision type and date, case
identifier, country, policy area, and more. Recent examples include the
Commission’s decisions to refer Ireland to court for <a

<p><strong>Global military spending.</strong> How much money has each
country spent, each year, on its military? Different datasets have
different answers, cover different timeframes, and use different
methodologies. <a href="https://osf.io/pkxt8">Miriam Barnum et al.</a>’s
<a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DHMZOW">Global
Military Spending Dataset</a> attempts to bring them together. By
uniting “76 variables from 9 dataset collection projects,” the authors
write, “we provide the most comprehensive and complete set of published
datasets on military spending ever assembled.” Each of the variables
represents one source/methodology, and each observation is a
country-year. “Disagreement on the actual expenditure value for a given
country-year is common, even between datasets produced by the same
project,” they find. <strong>Previously</strong>: The Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute’s <a
href="https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex">Military Expenditure
Database</a> (<a

<p><strong>Fatal police pursuits.</strong> Reporters at the San
Francisco Chronicle have compiled a <a
href="https://github.com/sfchronicle/police_pursuits">national
dataset</a> of 3,300+ deaths in police car chases in 2017–2022. <a
href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/us-world/article/police-chases-methodology-18685158.php">To
build it</a>, they used information from the federal government’s <a

Analysis Reporting System</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-08-31-edition/">DIP
2016.08.31</a>), research organizations, news reports, lawsuits, and
public records requests. For each death, the dataset indicates the
person’s name, age, gender, race, and connection to the pursuit (driver,
passenger, bystander, officer). It also includes the incident’s date,
location, reason given for the pursuit, and main law enforcement agency
involved. <strong>Read more</strong>: “<a

the <a href="https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/2732/2">Private
International Cartels dataset</a>, “which the author believes to be the
largest collection of legal-economic information on contemporary
price-fixing cartels.” It spans three decades (1990–2019) and covers
1,500+ suspected or convicted cartels, including 1,100+ that “have been
deemed guilty of price fixing by one or more antitrust authority.” It
also links those cartels to tens of thousands of companies and to 2,000+
individuals indicted or punished for their involvement. The dataset’s
variables include information about cartel geography, industry, market
share, overcharges, penalties, and much more.</p>

<p><em>Data Is Plural sends its heartfelt condolences to the <a

<p><strong>Climate funding.</strong> To develop its “<a
href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2023/">Global
Landscape of Climate Finance 2023</a>” report, the <a
href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/">Climate Policy
Initiative</a> gathered data on grants, loans, equity and other types of
“primary financing in real economy sectors that reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and build climate resilience.” The report, published in
November, identified ~$1.3 trillion in such financing globally in
2021–2022. A spreadsheet provided alongside it indicates the estimated
amount by year, region, sector, focus on mitigation vs. adaptation, type
of financial instrument, funder sector (public vs. private), and funder
type (development bank, corporation, institutional investors, etc.).
Reports from <a
href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/resources/publications/">earlier
years</a> include downloadable data for <a
href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-a-decade-of-data/">2019–2020</a>
and <a
href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/updated-view-on-the-global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2019/">2017–2018</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Federal laws since 1789.</strong> Political scientist and
“recovering lawyer” <a href="https://brianlibgober.com/">Brian
Libgober</a> has compiled a “<a
href="https://osf.io/qa289">comprehensive dataset of U.S. federal
laws</a>,” covering 49,000+ legislative enactments from 1789 to 2022.
Such a dataset has been elusive, <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02758-z">Libgober
notes</a>, in part “because such laws have been enacted over hundreds of
years, resulting in a complicated patchwork of documents published in
numerous and inconsistent formats.” His solution combines three key
sources: “the oldest meta data for the U.S. <em>Statutes at Large</em>
disseminated via HeinOnline, similar and more recent meta data through
the Governmental Printing Office, and finally the last six years of
law-making as described by the National Archives’ website.” The dataset
lists each law’s title, legislative session, date of passage,
source/citation identifiers, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>TSA complaint counts.</strong> The Transportation Security
Administration <a
href="https://www.tsa.gov/foia/readingroom">publishes</a> semi-regular
reports on the complaints it receives, aggregated by month, airport,
category, and subcategory. Unfortunately, the agency only publishes
those reports as PDFs, rather than structured data files. So volunteers
and I at the <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data
Liberation Project</a> have built a <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/tsa-complaint-counts">data
pipeline</a> to convert those PDFs <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/tsa-complaint-counts/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#data-guidance">into
tidy CSV files</a>, currently covering complaints to TSA at 440+
airports (and additional complaints not specifying any airport) from
January 2015 to January 2024. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a

<p><strong>High-school financial education.</strong> In a <a

19,000+ high-school classes that teach financial literacy, manually
collected from thousands of online course catalogs. Each row provides
details about the school (e.g., name, location, enrollment) and course,
including its title, description, duration, requirement status, and
whether financial literacy was the main focus or smaller component. An

dataset</a> indicates, annually for 1970–2024, which states required
such coursework for high school graduation.</p>

<p><strong>Trash interceptors.</strong> <a
href="https://www.mrtrashwheel.com/">Mr. Trash Wheel</a> is one of <a
href="https://www.mrtrashwheel.com/meet-the-trash-wheels/">four</a> “<a
href="https://www.mrtrashwheel.com/technology/">semi-autonomous trash

of each contraption’s collection history. For each dumpster filled since
May 2014, they list the date, weight and volume of trash, and estimated
number of plastic bottles, cigarette butts, and other types of items
extracted. [h/t <a href="https://codywinchester.com/">Cody

<p><strong>Self-driving stats.</strong> Companies wanting to test or
deploy self-driving cars on California’s public roads must receive a
permit from the state DMV’s <a
href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/">Autonomous
Vehicles Program</a>. As part of the requirements, these companies must
“submit annual reports to share how often their vehicles disengaged from
autonomous mode during tests (whether because of technology failure or
situations requiring the test driver/operator to take manual control of
the vehicle to operate safely).” These <a
href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/disengagement-reports/">disengagement
reports</a> indicate each vehicle’s company, permit number, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number">VIN</a>,
monthly miles driven, and annual disengagements — including vehicles
with none. And for each disengagement, the reports list the vehicle,
date, disengagement initiator (vehicle, test driver, remote operator, or
passenger), type of location, and a brief summary. [h/t <a

<p><strong>US wetlands.</strong> The <a

provides <a

from 160+ organizations</a>, coordinated through a <a

wetland and deepwater features,” and continues to receive updates.

<p><strong>SF overdose deaths.</strong> Last year, 813 people died from
accidental drug overdoses in San Francisco, <a

to the latest figures from the city’s Office of the Chief Medical
Examiner</a>. That’s the highest annual total on record, per the San

<p><strong>Spain’s political primaries.</strong> <a

Barberà et al.</a> have compiled a <a

of 361 primary contests in Spain since 1991, “based on information
provided by political parties at the time of the event through their
websites, press releases, and journalistic reports.” It includes
primaries to determine candidates for regional, national, and EU
elections, as well as for party leadership. For each contest, it lists
the party, territory, year, type of post, number of competitors,
turnout, incumbent’s outcome, winner’s percentage, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Scott’s SMS spam.</strong> In late September 2022, <a

every SMS he received, motivated by the recent passage of the Philippine

messages, which he has <a href="https://spamofthetimes.com/">grouped
into five categories and charted</a>: spam (13% of all messages),
one-time passwords (12%), marketing (10%), government notices (1%), and
“messages I both expect and welcome” (63%). He’s also <a

<p><strong>State trust lands.</strong> “State trust lands just might be
one of the best-kept public secrets in America,” <a
href="https://grist.org/updates/grist-publishes-new-land-grant-investigation-with-public-data/">according
to Grist</a>, which published a <a
href="https://grist.org/project/indigenous/land-grant-universities-indigenous-lands-fossil-fuels/">data-driven
investigation</a> on the topic last week. These lands — expropriated
from Indigenous nations and managed by state governments for profit —
“exist in 21 Western and Midwestern states, totaling more than 500
million surface and subsurface acres.” Grist’s inquiry focuses on those
benefiting <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-grant_university">land-grant
universities</a>, the subject of a related <a
href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/52-4/indigenous-affairs-education-land-grab-universities/">High
Country News investigation</a> (<a

identified</a> “more than 8.2 million acres of state trust parcels taken
from 123 tribes, bands, and communities” that fund 14 such institutions.
Their <a

<p><strong>Household composition.</strong> <a

et al.</a>’s <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/8142652">CORESIDENCE
database</a> provides 146 indicators of household arrangements in 156
countries and ~4,000 regions, spanning the years 1964 to 2021. The
indicators range in specificity, from average household size to, e.g.,
the average number of non-relatives in 3-person households. They also
include gender breakdowns, such as the proportion of 5-person households
among female-headed households. The metrics are calculated using
“global-scale individual microdata from four main repositories and
national household surveys, encompassing over 150 million individual
records representing more than 98% of the world’s population.”</p>

<p><strong>Comics, deconstructed.</strong> The Tilburg University–based
<a href="https://www.visuallanguagelab.com/">Visual Language Lab</a>,
led by comics scholar <a
href="https://www.visuallanguagelab.com/neilcohn">Neil Cohn</a>, studies
“all aspects of visual language, from the structure of individual
drawings, emoji, or cartoons, to how we make meaning out of sequences of
images like in comics.” The lab’s <a
href="https://www.visuallanguagelab.com/vlrc">Visual Language Research
Corpus</a> provides <a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-023-09673-0">detailed
annotations</a> of tens of thousands of panels in 300+ comic books and
graphic novels (plus every <em>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</em> strip). The <a
href="https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/LWMZ7G">dataset</a>’s
sources include material from multiple continents, time periods, and
genres. The annotations examine “attentional framing structure and
filmic shot scale, the situational changes across panels, page layouts,
multimodality, visual morphology, and path structure,” among other
characteristics. [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/hydrosquall">Cameron

<p><strong>Nursing home prices.</strong> Between December 2020 and March
2022, SeniorLiving.org researchers “attempted to contact 7,221 US senior
facilities by telephone to obtain availability and service pricing.” The
team got at least some pricing data for 3,000+ of the facilities. The
results, available from SeniorLiving’s <a
href="https://www.seniorliving.org/research/open-data-project/">data
portal</a>, provide information about each provider, the team’s call
attempts, and the average monthly price for five types of housing and
care: skilled nursing with a private room, skilled nursing with a shared
room, assisted living, independent living, and care tailored for people
with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. <strong>Related</strong>: The

South, US travel behavior, space X-rays, and amateur archaeological
finds.</em></p>

<p><strong>Local election results.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02792-x">Justin de
Benedictis-Kessner et al.</a> have compiled a <a
href="https://osf.io/mv5e6/">dataset</a> of 77,000+ (distinct)
candidates across 57,000+ US elections for mayor, city council, school
board, county executive, county legislature, sheriff, and prosecutor. It
is, they write, “the most comprehensive publicly-available source of
information on local elections across the entire country.” It includes
“most medium and large cities and counties” and spans 1989 to 2021. The
authors combined data from pre-existing databases, state election
websites, and newspaper archives. They also “worked with a team of
research assistants who coded results from thousands of local elections
based on city and county websites.” For each candidacy, the <a
href="https://osf.io/tbwzd">core table</a> indicates the election’s
jurisdiction, office, and timing, plus the candidate’s name, incumbency
status, party, estimated demographics, votes won, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mid-century anti-Black killings.</strong> The <a
href="https://crrjarchive.org/">Burnham-Nobles Archive</a> at the
Northeastern University School of Law is “dedicated to identifying,
classifying, and providing factual information and documentation about
anti-Black killings in the mid-century South.” The current version <a
href="https://crrjarchive.org/scope">focuses</a> on 11 southern states
during 1930–1954. Developed by political scientist <a
href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/melissa-nobles">Melissa Nobles</a>
and law professor <a
href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/burnham/">Margaret
Burnham</a>, the <a href="https://crrjarchive.org/archive">long-running
project</a> has gathered 12,000+ <a
href="https://crrjarchive.org/sources">news articles, death
certificates, federal agency records, and other sources</a>. It
documents 900+ incidents and 950+ victims, as well as alleged
perpetrators and judicial outcomes. The archive provides an <a
href="https://crrjarchive.org/map">interactive map</a>, <a
href="https://crrjarchive.org/catalog">record search</a> (including by

<p><strong>US travel behavior.</strong> Fielded every five to eight
years since 1968, the Federal Highway Administration’s <a
href="https://nhts.ornl.gov/">National Household Travel Survey</a> “is
the authoritative source on the travel behavior of the American public.”
The questionnaire asks respondents to inventory all of their household’s
trips taken during a 24-hour period. The most recent survey, for 2022,
includes ~31,000 trips by ~17,000 people in ~8,000 households. It
indicates each trip’s duration, vehicle details, motivation, parking
costs, traveler demographics, and much more. The FHA provides <a
href="https://nhts.ornl.gov/downloads">downloads of the anonymized
data</a>, as well as <a href="https://nhts.ornl.gov/documentation">user
guides and technical notes</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/02/02/school-bus-era-ends/">The
school bus is disappearing. Welcome to the era of the school pickup
line</a>,” by the Washington Post’s <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/andrew-van-dam/">Andrew Van
Dam</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Space X-rays.</strong> <a
href="https://erosita.mpe.mpg.de/">eROSITA</a> is a <a
href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/03/aa39313-20/aa39313-20.html">wide-field
X-ray telescope</a> “capable of delivering deep, sharp images over very
large areas of the sky,” helping researchers “to study the large-scale
structure of the universe.” The telescope launched into orbit in 2019 as
a collaboration between Russia and Germany, with data rights split
between the countries. In February 2022, following Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine, Germany’s Max Planck Institute <a
href="https://www.mpe.mpg.de/7856215/news20220303">suspended eROSITA’s
operations</a>. Data processing continued, however, and last week the
institute <a
href="https://www.mpe.mpg.de/7989698/news20240131">published</a> its <a
href="https://erosita.mpe.mpg.de/dr1/index.html">first data release</a>.
It contains the first six months of results for the hemisphere assigned
to Germany, and is “the largest X-ray catalogue ever published.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Amateur archaeological finds.</strong> The British Museum’s
<a
href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/our-work/national/treasure-and-portable-antiquities-scheme">Portable
Antiquities Scheme</a> “records archaeological finds discovered by the
public,” assisted by a network of national and local partners. Its <a
href="https://finds.org.uk/database">database</a> contains 1.1 million
records describing 1.7 million objects. “All have been found by everyday
people by chance, most through metal detecting.” The most common finds:
<a
href="https://finds.org.uk/database/search/results/objectType/COIN">coins</a>
(~500,000 records), <a
href="https://finds.org.uk/database/search/results/objectType/BUCKLE">buckles</a>
(~58,000), and <a
href="https://finds.org.uk/database/search/results/objectType/BROOCH">brooches</a>
(~52,000). Search <a
href="https://finds.org.uk/database/search/results">results</a> are
available in JSON, XML, and other structured formats. [h/t <a
