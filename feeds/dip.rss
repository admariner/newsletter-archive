      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Police misconduct settlements, congressional e-newsletters, California vaccine availability, illegal cheetah commerce, and soil.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Police misconduct settlements.</strong> Reporters at FiveThirtyEight and The Marshall Project filed freedom-of-information requests to 50 US cities, asking for data on all civil lawsuits against their police departments/officers “that resulted in a monetary legal settlement” in 2010–2019 — including incident and settlement dates, plaintiff and defendant names, allegation descriptions, amounts awarded, and more. They received <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/police-settlements">full or partial data from 31 of those cities</a>, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends/">found that</a> total payouts <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/02/22/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-that-s-where-the-accountability-ends">exceeded $3 billion</a>. <strong>Don’t miss</strong>: The data repository’s “<a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/police-settlements#words-of-caution">words of caution</a>,” which discourage comparisons between cities. <strong>Related</strong>: Coauthor Laura Bronner’s <a href="https://twitter.com/laurabronner/status/1363961281905106956">introductory Twitter thread</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Congressional e-newsletters.</strong> <a href="https://www.dcinbox.com/about">For more than a decade</a>, political scientist <a href="https://www.lindseycormack.com/">Lindsey Cormack</a>’s <a href="https://www.dcinbox.com/">DCinbox</a> project has collected “every official e-newsletter sent by sitting members of the U.S. House and Senate.” You can search the corpus online and also <a href="https://www.lindseycormack.com/dcinbox-data-downloads">download all the emails</a> as a series of CSV files, grouped by month. For each of the 130,000+ mailings, the files provide the date, subject, body, and sender’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/member-bioguide-ids">Bioguide</a> ID. (April 2020 was the highest-volume month, with more than 2,300 messages, nearly all of them mentioning the coronavirus.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>California vaccine availability.</strong> The volunteer-driven <a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/">VaccinateCA</a> project calls “hundreds of potential [COVID-19] vaccination sites daily, asking them if they have the vaccine and if so to whom they will administer it to and how to get an appointment.” You can examine the results on their website, and also use <a href="https://docs.vaccinateca.com/reference">their API</a> to access the latest data, which includes status reports on every California county, 20+ health care providers, and thousands of potential vaccination sites. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://blog.vaccinateca.com/what-weve-learned-so-far/">What We’ve Learned (So Far)</a>.” [h/t <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/28/vaccinateca/">Simon Willison</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Illegal cheetah commerce.</strong> A team of conservationists <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921001323">has compiled</a> a <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/84k92j4n3y">decade of data on illegal cheetah sales and ownership</a>, drawing from “over 300 sources, including direct communications with field informants, veterinarians, and cheetah owners,” court records, social media, and more. The dataset covers 1,800+ cases — including both actual seizures and alleged/suspected incidents — involving 4,000+ cheetahs or cheetah parts/derivatives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Soil.</strong> <a href="https://soilgrids.org/">SoilGrids</a> “uses state-of-the-art machine learning methods to map the spatial distribution of soil properties across the globe,” including organic carbon density, pH, clay content, and more. The maps use data from the <a href="https://www.isric.org/explore/wosis">World Soil Information Service</a>, which standardizes millions of soil records. Both projects are run by the <a href="https://isric.org/">International Soil Reference and Information Centre</a>, which also catalogs <a href="https://isric.org/explore/soil-geographic-databases">dozens of public-access soil datasets</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Indian court cases.</strong> The <a href="http://www.devdatalab.org/">Development Data Lab</a> has gathered <a href="http://www.devdatalab.org/judicial-bias-data">data on 81.2 million court cases</a> in India’s lower judiciary between 2010 and 2018, drawn from the country’s <a href="https://districts.ecourts.gov.in/">e-Courts platform</a>. It’s “the largest open-access dataset on judicial proceedings in the world,” <a href="https://devdatalab.medium.com/big-data-for-justice-f53e0e14c9c9">says project coauthor Aditi Bhowmick</a>. The public dataset contains each case’s state, district, court, case type, filing and decision dates, defendant and petitioner genders, legal codes, and more. It “has been fully anonymized to prevent the identification of individual judges or litigants,” but researchers can apply for more extensive access.

<p><strong>Hyperlocal Biden/Trump results.</strong> To create their “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/upshot/2020-election-map.html">Extremely Detailed Map of the 2020 Election</a>,” journalists at The Upshot have gathered and standardized the ballot results for more than 100,000 precincts in dozens of states so far — representing nearly two-thirds of all votes cast. The accompanying <a href="https://github.com/TheUpshot/presidential-precinct-map-2020">GeoJSON dataset</a> indicates the number of votes received by Joe Biden, by Donald Trump, and overall (including third-party and write-in candidates), joined to each precinct’s geographic boundaries.

<p><strong>Private prisons.</strong> Political scientist <a href="https://www.annagunderson.com/home">Anna Gunderson</a> has <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/why-do-states-privatize-their-prisons-the-unintended-consequences-of-inmate-litigation/AF814E16A605CA894D558AE72BEF65C9">assembled</a> a <a href="https://www.annagunderson.com/data/private-prisons">longitudinal dataset of private prisons</a> at the federal, state, and local level through 2016. Using decades of financial reports by the two largest operators, plus those by two other companies one later acquired, Gunderson’s dataset identifies each facility’s name, location, primary customer, capacity, security level, contract information, and more. <strong>Related</strong>: Last week, President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/executive-order-reforming-our-incarceration-system-to-eliminate-the-use-of-privately-operated-criminal-detention-facilities/">signed an executive order</a> to phase out the federal use of such facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Even more mortality data.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality">World Mortality Dataset</a> contains recent “all-cause mortality” counts for 79 countries, aggregated to weekly, monthly, or quarterly totals (depending on availability). Launched last week by researchers <a href="https://akarlinsky.github.io/">Ariel Karlinsky</a> and <a href="https://dkobak.github.io/">Dmitry Kobak</a>, the project draws on the <a href="https://www.mortality.org/">Human Mortality Database</a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Weekly_death_statistics&amp;stable">EuroStat</a>, and data <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/excess-deaths">collected by the New York Times</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-05-27-edition">DIP 2020.05.27</a>); and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250604v1">expands upon it</a> by gathering data from government websites and through direct inquiries.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Electoral attitudes, fishing activity, Bundestag writings, innovation licensing, and chess puzzles.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Electoral attitudes.</strong> The <a href="https://u.osu.edu/cnep/">Comparative National Elections Project</a> “is a partnership among scholars who have conducted election surveys on five continents,” with a focus on understanding the factors that shape voters’ decisions. The project’s <a href="https://u.osu.edu/cnep/surveys/surveys-through-2012/">publicly-available datasets</a> include 48 of the surveys, which use a combination of country-specific questions and <a href="https://u.osu.edu/cnep/common-core-questionnaire/">shared questionnaire</a> — asking about political news consumption, attitudes towards democracy, interpersonal communications, and other topics. <strong>Related</strong>: The <a href="https://cses.org/">Comparative Study of Electoral Systems</a>, a similar collaboration with “a special emphasis on voting and turnout.” [h/t <a href="https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData/commit/26ff4d1932024d71b29a1195597d5e5a64367cca">Erik Gahner Larsen</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Fishing activity.</strong> <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/">Global Fishing Watch</a> — initially organized as <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/about-us/">a collaboration</a> between conservationists and Google — uses satellite imagery, ship signals, and other sources “to visualise, track and share data about global fishing activity in near real-time and for free.” The project’s <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/">public datasets</a> (free registration required) examine various aspects of the industry, including the <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/fishing-effort/">geography of “fishing effort”</a> (2012–16) and <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/transshipment-success/report-first-global-view-transshipment-sea/">transshipment between vessels</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-brexit-eu-fisheries/">Why the U.K. and EU Are Fighting Over Fish</a>” (Bloomberg).

<p><strong>Bundestag writings.</strong> Political scientists <a href="https://corinna-kroeber.jimdofree.com/">Corinna Kroeber</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tremsch">Tobias Remschel</a> have <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/government-and-opposition/article/every-single-word-a-new-data-set-including-all-parliamentary-materials-published-in-germany/34D424C406687F7446C6F32980A4FE84">compiled</a> a <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/7EJ1KI">dataset</a> of “all written communication published by the German Bundestag between 1949 and 2017,” unifying <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/services/opendata">datasets released by Germany’s parliament</a> “in a manner easily accessible to researchers applying text analysis.” For each of the 131,835 reports, requests, bills, and other documents, the dataset provides the full text, date, author information, and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/L4OAKN">Six million parliamentary speeches from nine countries</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-04-29-edition">DIP 2020.04.29</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Innovation licensing.</strong> Government agencies often commercialize their innovations through “<a href="https://federallabs.org/learning-center/what-is-t2">technology transfer</a>” programs, which strike collaboration and licensing agreements with outside parties. NASA provides a <a href="https://technology.nasa.gov/api/">technology transfer API</a> for accessing data about its patent portfolio and software catalog; the National Institutes of Health offers a <a href="https://www.ott.nih.gov/nih-ott-api">similar API</a> for querying its licensing opportunities.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Megascale coronavirus surveys, commodity-transportation costs, more college sports financing, ten million Jupyter notebooks, and 2020 in haiku.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Megascale coronavirus surveys.</strong> Carnegie Mellon University’s <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/about/">epidemiological forecasting group</a> and Facebook have partnered to field a <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/surveys/">large-scale coronavirus survey in the US</a>; they’ve collected <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/">more than 15 million responses since April 2020</a>. The University of Maryland has <a href="https://covidmap.umd.edu/">formed a similar partnership</a> for an international survey, in which “a representative sample of Facebook users is invited on a daily basis to report on symptoms, social distancing behavior, mental health issues, and financial constraints”; <a href="https://ischool.umd.edu/news/university-maryland-carnegie-mellon-and-facebook-team-forecast-coronavirus-spread">millions have also participated</a>. Geographically-aggregated results of the US survey can be downloaded via an <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/export/">online interface</a> or <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html">Delphi’s API</a>; the international results are also <a href="https://covidmap.umd.edu/api.html">available via API</a>. <strong>Practical example</strong>: <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2020/12/13/are-masks-widely-used-in-public/">An analysis of state-by-state mask usage, with code</a>. [h/t <a href="https://www.refsmmat.com/">Alex Reinhart</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Commodity-transportation costs.</strong> The UN and the World Bank have <a href="https://unctad.org/news/why-and-how-measure-international-transport-costs">launched</a> a new <a href="https://unctadstat.unctad.org/EN/TransportCost.html">interactive map</a> and <a href="https://unctadstat.unctad.org/wds/ReportFolders/reportFolders.aspx?IF_ActivePath=P%2C207045">dataset</a> that quantify the transportation costs for international trade — country-by-country and broken down by mode of transportation (sea, air, rail, road), trading partner, and commodity. The numbers, based both on directly-reported figures and statistical modelling, include costs overall, per unit, and per unit per kilometer. The project currently covers only 2016, but has plans to expand. [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/JanHoffmann_gva/status/1341414753567186947">Jan Hoffmann</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>More college sports financing.</strong> The <a href="http://cafidatabase.knightcommission.org">College Athletics Financial Information Database</a>, run by the privately-funded <a href="https://www.knightcommission.org">Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics</a>, details the annual sources of revenue (such as ticket sales) and expenses (such as coaches’ compensation) for hundreds of schools, based on information self-reported to the NCAA and federal government. Many of the records <a href="http://cafidatabase.knightcommission.org/about-the-data">were obtained</a> via freedom-of-information requests by <a href="https://sports.usatoday.com/2020/07/05/methodology-for-2019-ncaa-athletic-department-revenue-database/">USA Today and Syracuse University students</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Millions of computational notebooks.</strong> In 2017, a team of researchers <a href="https://github.com/activityhistory/jupyter_on_github">downloaded and analyzed</a> 1.25 million publicly-available Jupyter notebooks — <a href="https://jupyter.org/">documents</a> that weave computational code, output, and text. They also <a href="https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb6931851t">published</a> the notebooks and their related metadata. Inspired by that project, a team at JetBrains recently did a follow-up scan, <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/datalore/2020/12/17/we-downloaded-10-000-000-jupyter-notebooks-from-github-this-is-what-we-learned/">analyzing and publishing data on nearly 10 million notebooks</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2020 in haiku.</strong> Over the course of 2020, <a href="https://twitter.com/elibryan">Eli Holder</a> paid workers on Mechanical Turk to turn news headlines into 5/7/5-syllable poems. The result: 2,760 “Doom Haikus,” which you can <a href="https://doomhaikus.3iap.co/">browse on a timeline</a> or <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/newshaikus/dataset">download in bulk</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Vaccine doses, county-level coronavirus tests, social scientists testifying, permafrost, and meat-washing.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vaccine doses.</strong> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org">Our World in Data</a> is tracking the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations">number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered</a> per country, compiling <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations">their dataset</a> from a range of government sources, including <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/22122020-01">press releases</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nadhimzahawi/status/1339143635586207744">ministers’ tweets</a>. In addition to <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations">listing the total doses administered</a>, the US Department of Health and Human Services is also <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/distribution/index.html">publishing datasets</a> that tally how many <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/saz5-9hgg">Pfizer-BioNTech</a> and <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/b7pe-5nws">Moderna</a> vaccine doses have been <em>allocated</em> and <em>shipped</em> to each state and territory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>County-level coronavirus tests.</strong> The US federal government has finally begun publishing county-level data on COVID-19 test counts, positivity rates, and delays. And that’s just a slice of <a href="https://github.com/CareSet/COVID_Community_Profile_Report_FAQ">the information now available</a> through the daily-updated, multi-agency <a href="https://beta.healthdata.gov/National/COVID-19-Community-Profile-Report/gqxm-d9w9">Community Profile Reports</a>, which also assign each county to a “concern category” and aggregate the metrics to the CBSA, state, and regional levels. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/rypan/status/1340012957321728001">Ryan Panchadsaram’s enthusiastic Twitter thread</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Social scientists testifying.</strong> In a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230104">paper published this spring</a>, Mahler et al. describe their dataset of <a href="https://osf.io/e3h98/">social scientists’ appearances in US congressional hearings</a> — more than 15,000 instances in all, at more than 10,000 hearings between 1946 and 2016. For each testimony, the dataset indicates the expert’s name, discipline, title, and professional affiliations, as well as the hearing’s date, title, and committee. Economists predominate, followed by political scientists, psychologists, sociologists, and then anthropologists. [h/t <a href="https://deblina.net/">Deblina Mukherjee</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Permafrost.</strong> The European Space Agency <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Space_for_our_climate/Long-term_permafrost_record_details_Arctic_thaw">has released</a> new <a href="https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/1f88068e86304b0fbd34456115b6606f">longitudinal data on the Northern Hemisphere’s permafrost</a> — ground that remains 0°C/32°F or colder for at least two years. Through a combination of satellite detection and on-the-ground measurements, the datasets quantify the permafrost’s thickness, extent, and temperature between 1997 and 2017.

<p><strong>Who washes meat?</strong> YouTuber (and former public radio reporter) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/aragusea/about">Adam Ragusea</a> recently <a href="https://youtu.be/U_PMnCpaJiQ?t=742">asked his viewers</a> to answer a detailed survey about whether (and why, and how) they wash meat before cooking it. He received more than 13,000 responses. He then made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Nd_vh3yk8">video about what he found</a> and published a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eygYpBJQGFd4wHH8iYsLoy3PR8PmHN0O/view">spreadsheet of the anonymized answers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>People of slavery.</strong> <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/sweeping-new-digital-database-emphasizes-enslaved-peoples-individuality-180976513/">Recently launched</a>, <a href="https://enslaved.org/">Enslaved.org</a> allows the public to “explore or reconstruct the lives of individuals who were enslaved, owned slaves, or participated in the historical trade.” Its interactive database contains 600,000+ records, with plans to expand. The <a href="https://enslaved.org/about">collaborative, schlolar-led project</a> also includes <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/">The Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation</a>, which “publishes original, peer-reviewed datasets about the lives of enslaved Africans and their descendants.” The <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullIssue/volume1-issue1">first issue</a> features three datasets <a href="http://slavebiographies.org/databases.php">originally published</a> through a <a href="https://enslaved.org/projectHistory">precursor</a> to Enslaved.org — <a href="http://slavebiographies.org/about.php">Slave Biographies: The Atlantic Database Network</a>. Those <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/jsdp">datasets</a> focus on <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue1-louisiana-slave-database">Louisiana slaves</a> (1719–1820), <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue1-free-blacks-database">New Orleans “Free Blacks”</a> (1840–1860), and <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue1-maranhao-inventories-slave-database">enslaved Africans in Maranhão, Brazil</a> (1767–1831).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>More PPP details.</strong> Thanks to a FOIA lawsuit by a group of news organizations, the US Small Business Administration has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sba-releases-detailed-information-on-more-small-business-borrowers-under-ppp-pandemic-relief-effort-11606874820">released additional data</a> about the financial assistance distributed through its Paycheck Protection Program. Previously (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-07-08-edition">DIP 2020.07.08</a>), the SBA’s public data withheld the specific amounts for all loans (instead listing only a broad range), as well as names and addresses for loans below $150,000. <a href="https://sba.app.box.com/s/5myd1nxutoq8wxecx2562baruz774si6">The new datasets</a> include those amounts, names, and addresses for all loans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>More on travel/immigration bans.</strong> The <a href="https://covidborderaccountability.org">COVID Border Accountability Project</a> is tracking countries’ pandemic-related travel and immigration restrictions, on a weekly basis. The <a href="https://covidborderaccountability.org/about.html">project’s team</a> categorizes various aspects of the restrictions — whether they hinge on citizenship, halt new visa applications, et cetera — and turns them into <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/U6DJAC">a longitudinal dataset</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/covid-19-global-travel-restrictions-and-airline-information">The UN World Food Program’s travel-restrictions dataset</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-12-09-edition">DIP 2020.12.09</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Third-Republic France.</strong> Economist <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/victorgayeco/">Victor Gay</a> has built <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/TRF-GIS">a geographic dataset</a> that traces, year by year, the administrative boundaries of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic">France’s Third Republic</a>, which governed from 1870 to 1940, when the Vichy Regime took power. The dataset <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02951461">provides</a> annual shapefiles delineating the country’s départements, arrondissements, and cantons; as well as for its “most significant special administrative constituencies: military, judicial and penitentiary, electoral, academic, labor inspection, and ecclesiastical.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cyber wargames.</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920306788">This</a> is, “to the best of our knowledge, [...] the first dataset providing network traffic traces and corresponding event logs from a complex cyber defense exercise” — a two-day <a href="https://csirt.muni.cz/projects/cyber-czech">Cyber Czech</a> event in March 2019.</p>
