<p><strong>Recessions and expansions.</strong> The US has no official
definition of a recession, but many observers look to the
non-governmental <a href="https://www.nber.org/about-nber">National
Bureau of Economic Research</a>, whose <a
href="https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating">Business
Cycle Dating Committee</a> tries to determine “the dates of peaks and
troughs that frame economic recessions and expansions.” The committee <a
href="https://www.nber.org/research/data/us-business-cycle-expansions-and-contractions">publishes
a table and data files</a> listing those dates for dozens of cycles
since the mid-1800s. But <a
href="https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating/business-cycle-dating-procedure-frequently-asked-questions">be
prepared to wait</a>: “Our determination of the trough date in April
2020 occurred 15 months after that date, in July 2021. Earlier
determinations took between 4 and 21 months.” [h/t <a

<p><strong>Consumer finances.</strong> Every three years since 1983, the
US Federal Reserve has conducted its <a
href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/aboutscf.htm">Survey of
Consumer Finances</a>, which asks a sample of families detailed
questions about their income, savings, assets, pensions, loans, credit
lines, demographics, and more. “No other study for the country collects
comparable information,” according to the Fed. The <a
href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm">most recent
edition</a> interviewed 5,783 families <a
href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-bulletin-changes-in-us-family-finances-from-2016-to-2019.htm">between

<p><strong>Young adult migration.</strong> Researchers at Harvard
University and the Census Bureau have linked federal tax filings, Census
records, and other government data to track the <a
href="https://migrationpatterns.org/">migration patterns of young US
residents</a>. Specifically, for each person born in the US between 1984
and 1992, the researchers compared where they lived at age 16 to where
they lived at age 26. The project’s public dataset counts the
approximate number who moved to/from each pair of <a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-01-19-edition/">commuting
zones</a> — overall and disaggregated by race/ethnicity and parental
income level. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Employee benefit plans, European cropland, Christianity in China,
data governance ratings, and diplomatic gifts.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Employee benefit plans.</strong> US companies that offer
their employees a retirement plan, such as a pension or 401(k), must
report the particulars of those plans through <a
href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/employers-and-advisers/plan-administration-and-compliance/reporting-and-filing/form-5500">Form
5500</a> — a creation of the IRS, Department of Labor, and <a
href="https://www.pbgc.gov/">Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</a>.
Employers offering health plans, vacation, or other welfare benefits to
100+ workers must typically report those, too. The Department of Labor
publishes <a
href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/public-disclosure/foia/form-5500-datasets">datasets
with details from all Form 5500 submissions</a> going back to 1999, as
well as a <a href="https://www.efast.dol.gov/5500search/">search
tool</a> that goes back to 2010. <strong>Related</strong>: Through a
FOIA request, <a href="https://dan-bauman.com/">Dan Bauman</a> has <a
href="https://github.com/danbauman77/tophat">obtained decades of
metadata on 80,000+ “top hat” statements</a>, which <a
href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/about-ebsa/about-us/erisa-advisory-council/2020-examining-top-hat-plan-participation-and-reporting.pdf">concern
plans</a> “providing deferred compensation for a select group of
management or highly compensated employees.” [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>European cropland.</strong> <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08151">Maja Schneider et al.</a>’s <a
href="https://github.com/maja601/EuroCrops">EuroCrops</a> project
combines “all publicly available self-declared crop reporting datasets
from countries of the European Union.” So far, that universe corresponds
to the entirety or parts of 16 countries. The project’s datasets include
various attributes from the original data files, geographic coordinates
for each agricultural parcel, and each parcel’s primary crop type, which
the authors have standardized using a taxonomy they devised.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Christianity in China.</strong> The <a
href="https://chcdatabase.com/">China Historical Christian Database</a>,
a project based at Boston University’s School of Theology, spans the
years 1550 to 1950. Launched <a
href="https://www.bu.edu/cgcm/2022/07/19/11962/">last week</a>, it
provides “tools to discover where every Christian church, school,
hospital, orphanage, publishing house, and the like were located in
China,” plus “who worked inside those buildings, both foreign and
Chinese.” The database, available to <a
href="https://github.com/chcdatabase/data">download</a> and <a

entities, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Data governance ratings</strong>. A <a
href="https://datagovhub.letsnod.com/">new report</a> from George
Washington University’s <a
href="https://datagovhub.elliott.gwu.edu/">Digital Trade and Data
Governance Hub</a> rates 68 countries on their approaches to data
governance. It scores each country on 26 indicators across 6 categories
— for instance, whether it has a personal data protection law, publishes
an open data portal, and/or says it adheres to the <a
href="https://oecd.ai/en/ai-principles">OECD AI Principles</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Diplomatic gifts.</strong> Federal employees are <a
href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7342">not supposed to
accept major gifts</a> from foreign governments. But exceptions occur,
such as “when it appears that to refuse the gift would likely cause
offense or embarrassment,” and agencies must annually report those
exceptions in the Federal Register. In 2020, <a

<p><strong>Wildfires around the world.</strong> The <a
href="https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">Global Wildfire Information
System</a>, expanding on the work of <a
href="https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">European Forest Fire Information
System</a>, uses satellite data to provide <a
href="https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/apps/gwis.statistics/">weekly and
annual estimates</a> of the number of fires and area burned in 200+
countries. Its <a
href="https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/apps/country.profile/downloads">bulk
data</a> indicates monthly burned hectares by country, sub-country unit,
and land type from 2002 to 2019, as well as the boundaries of individual
fires from 2001 to 2020. It also publishes <a

<p><strong>Hospital price lists.</strong> Since January 2021, the US
government <a href="https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency">has
required hospitals to publish</a> machine-readable files listing the
standard charges for all items and services they provide. But there’s no
standard format for these price lists (also known as “chargemasters”),
no official central repository of them, and <a
href="https://www.patientrightsadvocate.org/semi-annual-compliance-report-2022">compliance
has been lacking</a>. Seeing those problems, the versioned-data platform
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a> earlier this year ran a
<a
href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-04-22-hospital-price-transparency-retrospective/">paid

href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-07-01-hospitals-compliance/">nearly
300 million prices from the published lists of roughly 1,800
hospitals</a> into a <a

<p><strong>New voting laws.</strong> The <a
href="https://votingrightslab.org/">Voting Rights Lab</a> has been <a
href="https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/pending/search">tracking
2,000+ laws proposed in US state legislatures</a> since 2021. The
tracker focuses on “12 major issue areas relating to voter access and
representation,” such as early voting, same-day registration, and ID
requirements. It lists each bill’s state, number, author, date
introduced, current status, and issue areas, plus a summary and the
lab’s “assessment of whether the legislation is likely to improve or
interfere with voter access or the administration of elections.”

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Heat metrics.</strong> When you talk about outdoor heat,
you’re likely referring to “dry-bulb” temperatures, measured by a
thermometer shielded from the sun and moisture. But other factors also
contribute to the physiological experience of hot weather. To that end,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01405-3">Keith R.
Spangler et al.</a> have created a <a
href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19419836">dataset</a>

heat metrics</a> for every county in the contiguous United States from
2000 through 2020. That first metric, for instance, was “originally
developed in the 1950s to establish epidemiologically relevant thermal
thresholds to prevent heat-related illnesses at US military training
camps,” and takes humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed into
account.</p>

<p><strong>Technology adoption.</strong> <a

statistics</a> “on the adoption of over 100 technologies in more than
150 countries since 1800.” Examples include the number of telegrams
sent, television sets in use, knee replacement surgeries performed, and
metric tons of freight carried on railways. Last month, <a

<p><em>👋 As some eagle-eyed readers have noticed, last month I started
syndicating Data Is Plural at <a

<p><strong>Monkeypox cases.</strong> <a
href="https://global.health/">Global.health</a>, a <a
href="https://global.health/about/">data-sharing initiative</a> launched
during the COVID-19 pandemic, has compiled a <a
href="https://github.com/globaldothealth/monkeypox">dataset of 2,500+
confirmed cases</a> from this year’s <a

outbreak</a>. Drawing from government and media sources, the <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEBhao3rMe-qtCbAgJTn5ZKQMRFWeAeaiXFpBY3gbHE/edit#gid=0">dataset</a>
lists each case’s country and publicly known characteristics, such as
the patient’s gender, age range, date of confirmation, and/or symptoms.

<p><strong>Ukraine air raid alerts.</strong> <a

channel. The notifications serve as a digital counterpart to the sirens
that warn residents of potentially-imminent Russian air attacks.
Agafonkin’s <a

indicates the starting and ending times of 8,000+ alerts for 240
locations since March 15. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a

of <a

interest rates</a>, which central banks adjust to influence inflation
and other aspects of the economy. The dataset, which includes both
official policy rates and analogous precursors, covers three dozen
countries plus the European Central Bank. The records span decades,
going as far back as 1946 for Denmark, India, Japan, Sweden,
Switzerland, and the UK; 1954 for the US; 1960 for Canada; and 1976 for
Australia.</p>

families.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Consumer prices.</strong> The US Bureau of Labor Statistics’
widely-cited <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/">Consumer Price Index</a>
measures “the average change over time in the prices paid by urban
consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.” In
addition to overall averages, the index provides <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm">decades of detailed data</a> on
monthly price changes for <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/additional-resources/index-publication-level.htm">hundreds
of sub-baskets</a>, ranging from broad groupings (e.g., apparel,
housing, education) to narrower categories (e.g., frozen vegetables,
window coverings, veterinarian services). [h/t <a

Reilley</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Incarceration and redistricting.</strong> The US Census
counts prisoners as residing where they are incarcerated. In 2010,
however, <a
href="https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A9710-D.html">New York
passed a law</a> requiring the state to adjust these figures for
redistricting purposes, reassigning people in state and federal prisons
to their pre-incarceration addresses. Those adjusted counts, down to the
Census block level, are available for <a
href="https://latfor.state.ny.us/data/?sec=2010amendpop">2010</a> and <a
href="https://latfor.state.ny.us/data/?sec=2020amendpop">2020</a>. A <a
href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/ny/2020/report.html">new
report</a> from the <a
href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/about.html">Prison Policy
Initiative</a> and <a href="https://vocal-ny.org/about-us/">VOCAL-NY</a>
cross-references the 2020 data with the original Census numbers to
determine <a

prison incarceration rates</a> for each <a

<a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/ny/2020/zipcode.html">ZIP
code</a>, and other geographies. PPI says it <a
href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/">plans to issue similar
reports</a> for other states that have <a
href="https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/news/2021/10/26/state_count/">enacted
comparable reforms</a>. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Drug combinations.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01360-z">Guy Shtar et
al.</a>’s <a
href="https://icc.ise.bgu.ac.il/medical_ai/CDCDB/">Continuous Drug
Combination Database</a> identifies 17,000+ unique medical drug
combinations that have generated clinical interest, “curated
automatically” from <a

2017.03.08</a>), and international patent records. The automated
approach allows the database to be “continuously updated,” with new
versions published weekly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Airplane laser incidents.</strong> “Aiming a laser at an
aircraft is a serious safety risk and violates federal law,” <a
href="https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers">according</a> to the
Federal Aviation Administration, which encourages flight staff and the
public <a
href="https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/safety/report/laserinfo/">to submit
reports of such incidents</a>. The agency publishes <a
href="https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers/laws">annual
spreadsheets</a> of each reported incident since 2010, listing the date
and time, flight number, aircraft model, altitude, local airport, laser
color, and an injury indicator.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>European royal families.</strong> In “<a
href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20180521">A Network
of Thrones</a>,” economists <a href="https://www.sethgbenzell.com/">Seth

describe building a <a

study the effect of family ties on conflict” between 1495 and 1918. The
kinship records come from <a
