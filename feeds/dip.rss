<p><em>👋 Welcome to the 300th(!) edition of Data Is Plural. To mark the
occasion, I’ve published a <a
href="https://github.com/data-is-plural/feedback-phrases">bonus,
self-referential, ultra-niche dataset of the newsletter’s
feedback-soliciting phrases</a>.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Congress gets an official API.</strong> The United States’
legislative branch now has <a href="https://api.congress.gov/">an
official API</a>, <a
href="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2022/09/introducing-the-congress-gov-api/">the
Library of Congress announced last week</a>. It <a
href="https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/">provides</a>
structured data on legislators, bills, bill summaries, amendments,
committee reports, appointee nominations, international treaties, and
more. To use the service, you’ll need to <a
href="https://api.congress.gov/sign-up/">sign up for a free API key</a>.

<p><strong>Voter ID laws.</strong> As part of his PhD research, <a

Barton</a> has <a
href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00344893.2022.2113117">constructed</a>
a <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/RU2F9A">dataset
of voter identification requirements around the world</a>. For each
country and US state, the dataset indicates the type of identification
needed to vote (a photo ID, non-photo ID, or just basic personal
details), how many forms of identification the voter must provide, and
more. <strong>Related</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Local internet speeds.</strong> If you’ve tried measuring
your internet speed, you might have used <a
href="https://www.ookla.com/">Ookla</a>’s <a
href="https://www.speedtest.net/">testing service</a>. The company <a
href="https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good/open-data">releases</a> a
series of <a
href="https://github.com/teamookla/ookla-open-data">quarterly datasets
that summarize the test results</a>, aggregated into geospatial tiles.
(The tile sizes vary by latitude but measure roughly 2,000 feet by 2,000
feet at the equator.) For each tile, the datasets list the number of
tests performed and devices tested, plus the average download speed,
upload speed, and latency. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Billion-dollar disasters, business formations, attempted repairs,
Luftwaffe locations, and a fern tree of life.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>👋 A reader recently asked what criteria I use to evaluate
datasets for DIP. I’ve received similar questions in the past, so I
decided to write an FAQ-style public response, which you can <a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/faq/criteria/">find here</a>. It’s
a rough draft; feedback very much welcome.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Billion-dollar disasters.</strong> As “the Nation’s
Scorekeeper in terms of addressing severe weather and climate events in
their historical perspective,” the US <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/">National Centers for Environmental
Information</a> maintains an <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/">inventory of the most
costly such disasters in the US</a> — those that have caused at least $1
billion in estimated direct losses. The quarterly-updated dataset
contains more than 330 severe storms, floods, droughts, wildfires,
freezes, and other extreme events since 1980. You can <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events">download,
filter, and sort the list</a> (by disaster type, start/end dates,
inflation-adjusted cost, and total deaths), as well as <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/mapping">map</a>, <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/time-series">chart</a>,
and <a

it. [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Business formations.</strong> To compile its <a
href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html">Business Formation
Statistics</a>, the US Census Bureau <a
href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/methodology.html">analyzes several
sources</a>, including every application to the IRS for an Employer
Identification Number (EIN) and those applicants’ first payroll tax
filings. This allows the Bureau to provide monthly counts of business
applications and formations by <a
href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/about_the_data.html">business
type</a>, industrial sector, and state. They also publish weekly
datasets of application counts by state and an annual dataset that
drills down to individual counties; both, however, lack business
formation counts and other details <a
href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/about_the_data.html">found only in
the monthly files</a>. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Attempted repairs.</strong> The <a
href="https://openrepair.org/">Open Repair Alliance</a>, “an
international group of organisations committed to working towards a
world where electrical and electronic products are more durable and
easier to repair,” is developing <a
href="https://openrepair.org/open-data/open-standard/">an open standard
for sharing data about those repairs</a>. So far, they’ve <a
href="https://openrepair.org/open-data/downloads/">gathered 62,000+
records from five partners</a>. Each entry represents a repair session:
its date and country, the product’s brand and <a
href="https://standard.openrepair.org/standard.html#product-category-values">category</a>,
the repair status, a description of the problem, barriers to repair, and
more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Luftwaffe locations.</strong> Data scientist <a
href="https://scweiss.blogspot.com/">Sam Weiss</a> has constructed a <a
href="https://github.com/samcarlos/luftwaffe_locations">dataset tracking
the World War II movements of the Luftwaffe</a>, Nazi Germany’s air
force. The information, scraped and geocoded from the Luftwaffe-history
website <a href="https://ww2.dk/">ww2.dk</a>, includes monthly locations
and aggregate statistics (total size, additions, losses) by aircraft
type and unit. <strong>Read more</strong>: A <a

<p><strong>Recessions and expansions.</strong> The US has no official
definition of a recession, but many observers look to the
non-governmental <a href="https://www.nber.org/about-nber">National
Bureau of Economic Research</a>, whose <a
href="https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating">Business
Cycle Dating Committee</a> tries to determine “the dates of peaks and
troughs that frame economic recessions and expansions.” The committee <a
href="https://www.nber.org/research/data/us-business-cycle-expansions-and-contractions">publishes
a table and data files</a> listing those dates for dozens of cycles
since the mid-1800s. But <a
href="https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating/business-cycle-dating-procedure-frequently-asked-questions">be
prepared to wait</a>: “Our determination of the trough date in April
2020 occurred 15 months after that date, in July 2021. Earlier
determinations took between 4 and 21 months.” [h/t <a

questions about their income, savings, assets, pensions, loans, credit
lines, demographics, and more. “No other study for the country collects
comparable information,” according to the Fed. The <a

<p><strong>Young adult migration.</strong> Researchers at Harvard
University and the Census Bureau have linked federal tax filings, Census
records, and other government data to track the <a
href="https://migrationpatterns.org/">migration patterns of young US
residents</a>. Specifically, for each person born in the US between 1984
and 1992, the researchers compared where they lived at age 16 to where
they lived at age 26. The project’s public dataset counts the
approximate number who moved to/from each pair of <a

zones</a> — overall and disaggregated by race/ethnicity and parental

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Employee benefit plans.</strong> US companies that offer
their employees a retirement plan, such as a pension or 401(k), must
report the particulars of those plans through <a
href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/employers-and-advisers/plan-administration-and-compliance/reporting-and-filing/form-5500">Form
5500</a> — a creation of the IRS, Department of Labor, and <a
href="https://www.pbgc.gov/">Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</a>.
Employers offering health plans, vacation, or other welfare benefits to
100+ workers must typically report those, too. The Department of Labor
publishes <a
href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/public-disclosure/foia/form-5500-datasets">datasets
with details from all Form 5500 submissions</a> going back to 1999, as
well as a <a href="https://www.efast.dol.gov/5500search/">search
tool</a> that goes back to 2010. <strong>Related</strong>: Through a
FOIA request, <a href="https://dan-bauman.com/">Dan Bauman</a> has <a

<p><strong>European cropland.</strong> <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08151">Maja Schneider et al.</a>’s <a
href="https://github.com/maja601/EuroCrops">EuroCrops</a> project
combines “all publicly available self-declared crop reporting datasets
from countries of the European Union.” So far, that universe corresponds
to the entirety or parts of 16 countries. The project’s datasets include
various attributes from the original data files, geographic coordinates
for each agricultural parcel, and each parcel’s primary crop type, which
the authors have standardized using a taxonomy they devised.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Christianity in China.</strong> The <a
href="https://chcdatabase.com/">China Historical Christian Database</a>,
a project based at Boston University’s School of Theology, spans the
years 1550 to 1950. Launched <a
href="https://www.bu.edu/cgcm/2022/07/19/11962/">last week</a>, it
provides “tools to discover where every Christian church, school,
hospital, orphanage, publishing house, and the like were located in
China,” plus “who worked inside those buildings, both foreign and
Chinese.” The database, available to <a
href="https://github.com/chcdatabase/data">download</a> and <a

Washington University’s <a
href="https://datagovhub.elliott.gwu.edu/">Digital Trade and Data
Governance Hub</a> rates 68 countries on their approaches to data
governance. It scores each country on 26 indicators across 6 categories
— for instance, whether it has a personal data protection law, publishes
an open data portal, and/or says it adheres to the <a

<p><strong>Diplomatic gifts.</strong> Federal employees are <a
href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7342">not supposed to
accept major gifts</a> from foreign governments. But exceptions occur,
such as “when it appears that to refuse the gift would likely cause
offense or embarrassment,” and agencies must annually report those
exceptions in the Federal Register. In 2020, <a

<p><strong>Hospital price lists.</strong> Since January 2021, the US
government <a href="https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency">has
required hospitals to publish</a> machine-readable files listing the
standard charges for all items and services they provide. But there’s no
standard format for these price lists (also known as “chargemasters”),
no official central repository of them, and <a
href="https://www.patientrightsadvocate.org/semi-annual-compliance-report-2022">compliance
has been lacking</a>. Seeing those problems, the versioned-data platform
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a> earlier this year ran a
<a
href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-04-22-hospital-price-transparency-retrospective/">paid
crowdsourcing campaign</a> that pulled <a
href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-07-01-hospitals-compliance/">nearly
300 million prices from the published lists of roughly 1,800
hospitals</a> into a <a

<p><strong>New voting laws.</strong> The <a

href="https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/pending/search">tracking
2,000+ laws proposed in US state legislatures</a> since 2021. The
tracker focuses on “12 major issue areas relating to voter access and
representation,” such as early voting, same-day registration, and ID
requirements. It lists each bill’s state, number, author, date
introduced, current status, and issue areas, plus a summary and the
lab’s “assessment of whether the legislation is likely to improve or
interfere with voter access or the administration of elections.”

payments in India, and early movie theaters in Oregon.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Heat metrics.</strong> When you talk about outdoor heat,
you’re likely referring to “dry-bulb” temperatures, measured by a
thermometer shielded from the sun and moisture. But other factors also
contribute to the physiological experience of hot weather. To that end,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01405-3">Keith R.
Spangler et al.</a> have created a <a
href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19419836">dataset</a>
containing daily estimates of the <a
href="https://www.weather.gov/tsa/wbgt">wet-bulb globe temperature</a>,
<a href="http://www.utci.org/">Universal Thermal Climate Index</a>, <a
href="https://www.weather.gov/ama/heatindex">heat index</a>, <a
href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/seasonal-weather-hazards/warm-season-weather-hazards.html#toc7">humidex</a>,
and <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01405-3/tables/4">other
heat metrics</a> for every county in the contiguous United States from
2000 through 2020. That first metric, for instance, was “originally
developed in the 1950s to establish epidemiologically relevant thermal
thresholds to prevent heat-related illnesses at US military training
camps,” and takes humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed into
account.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Technology adoption.</strong> <a
href="https://www.dcomin.host.dartmouth.edu/">Diego A. Comin</a> and <a
href="https://www.barthobijn.net/">Bart Hobijn</a>’s <a

statistics</a> “on the adoption of over 100 technologies in more than
150 countries since 1800.” Examples include the number of telegrams
sent, television sets in use, knee replacement surgeries performed, and
metric tons of freight carried on railways. Last month, <a
