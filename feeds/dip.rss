<p><strong>Tariffs.</strong> The <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/">United
States International Trade Commission</a> maintains <a
href="https://dataweb.usitc.gov/tariff/annual">annual datasets of US
import tariffs</a> going back to 1997. The datasets include each
impacted product’s eight-digit <a

election results, and synthesizers.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SBA disaster loans.</strong> “Following a declared disaster,”
the US Small Business Administration <a
href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/disaster-assistance">offers</a>
“disaster assistance in the form of low-interest, long-term disaster
loans for damages not covered by insurance or other recoveries to
businesses of all sizes, private nonprofit organizations, as well as
homeowners and renters.” The SBA <a
href="https://data.sba.gov/dataset/disaster-loan-data">publishes
anonymized data</a> about each such loan in fiscal years 2000 to 2022,
drawn directly from its <a
href="https://www.sba.gov/document/report-disaster-credit-management-system-20">Disaster
Credit Management System</a>. The records provide the relevant disaster
declaration IDs, property type, ZIP code, city, county, state, verified
losses (in real estate and in “content”), and approved loan amounts.

<p><strong>US buildings.</strong> “Leveraging high performance
computing, remote sensing, geographic data science, machine learning,
and computer vision,” <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03219-x">Hsiuhan Lexie
Yang et al.</a>, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, have
“partnered with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to build a
baseline structure inventory covering the US and its territories to
support disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.” The <a
href="https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures">dataset and
interactive map</a> trace the outlines of 125 million buildings and, in
many cases, <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03219-x/tables/2">contain</a>
the building’s address, occupancy class, usage type, height, elevation,
and other attributes. They also provide information about the imagery
used to identify the structure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The cost of sustenance.</strong> The UN <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme">World Food
Programme</a>’s <a
href="https://www.wfp.org/publications/fill-nutrient-gap">Fill the
Nutrient Gap</a> initiative conducted a series of analyses in 2015
through 2021 to “calculate the costs of energy-sufficient and
nutrient-adequate diets and the percentage of households that were
unable to afford each diet.” In a recent paper, <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912424000609">Zuzanna
Turowska et al.</a> describe the analyses’ methodology and share their
results as a dataset. For each of the 37 countries analyzed, the dataset
contains one row per geographic unit, timeframe, and type of household
member; each row provides the cost and unaffordability estimates for
that category.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>German election results.</strong> <a
href="http://www.german-elections.com/">GERDA</a>, a new project by <a
href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q28ex">Vincent Heddesheimer et
al.</a>, “provides a comprehensive dataset of local, state, and federal
election results in Germany.” The results go back to 1953 for federal
elections, to 1990 for local elections, and to 1996 for state elections.
The files indicate each geographic unit’s number of eligible voters,
actual voters, valid votes, invalid votes, and vote shares by party. The
authors have also created “geographically harmonized datasets that
account for changes in municipal boundaries and mail-in voting
districts.”</p>

datasets tracking each state agency’s progress <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm">processing</a>
disability claims. The datasets, which go back to October 2000, count
the number of initial claims received, pending, determined, and approved
by each agency during each period, as well as similar breakdowns for
denial reconsiderations and <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-cdrs-ussi.htm">continuing disability

weather data, and other sources to estimate the volume of <a
href="https://etdata.org/faq/">evapotranspiration</a> — “the process by
which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere” — at a
30-meter resolution across 17 states in the western US. The results are

<p><strong>Landslides.</strong> The US Geological Survey has <a

a <a
href="https://usgs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=ae120962f459434b8c904b456c82669d">new
map of landslide susceptibility</a>, indicating the specific areas of
the country (at 90-meter resolution) that are at greatest risk of
slides. The map and county-level metrics are also <a
href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/65ccea5bd34ef4b119cb3bac">available
as structured data</a>. To calculate the susceptibilities, <a
href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024AV001214">Benjamin
B. Mirus et al.</a> combined data from the agency’s <a

Program</a> and a <a
href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61f326dfd34e622189b93308">national
landslide inventory that they updated</a>. The latter provides the
location (as a single point or more detailed boundary), timing, number
of fatalities, and confidence level for 610,000+ landslides (or evidence
of them) in the US since the early 1900s. The researchers also consulted
data from state landslide inventories published by <a

continuously fielding</a> its <a

Nutrition Examination Survey</a>, interviewing and testing approximately
5,000 people in 15 different counties each year. The survey combines
“demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions” with
an “examination component” involving “medical, dental, and physiological
measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained
medical personnel.” Its <a

<p><strong>Italian tax-to-charity allocations.</strong> Italy’s “five

Bloomberg News investigation</a> into the US government’s annual H-1B
lottery, a key step in allocating the country’s skilled-worker visas,
finds that “thousands of companies got an unfair advantage by helping
themselves to extra lottery tickets.” To reach those conclusions, the
team “obtained data on all H-1B lottery registrations, selections, and
petitions for fiscal years 2021 through 2024 after bringing a lawsuit
against the Department of Homeland Security under the Freedom of
Information Act.” They’ve <a

the proposed beneficiary’s gender, nationality, and birth year. For

<p><strong>The Freedman’s Bank.</strong> The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman%27s_Savings_Bank">Freedman’s
Savings and Trust Company</a> was chartered by Congress in 1865, toward
the end of the Civil War, to provide banking services to formerly
enslaved Americans. “Though the bank achieved some early successes, it
failed catastrophically in 1874, destroying the savings of a broad swath
of newly freed black citizens,” write <a
href="https://www.malcolmwardlaw.info/">Malcolm Wardlaw</a> and <a
href="https://www.virginiatraweek.com/">Virginia Traweek</a>, who have
<a href="https://freedmansbank.uga.edu/">constructed several
datasets</a> based on handwritten records preserved by the federal
government. One dataset lists <a
href="https://freedmansbank.uga.edu/project/passbooks/">5,000+
transactions</a> from 500+ accounts’ “passbooks”, indicating the account
holder, city, transaction type, date, and amount. Another lists <a
href="https://freedmansbank.uga.edu/project/dividendrecord/">40,000+
accounts’ final balances</a> at the time of the bank’s failure.

<p><strong>Recreational boating accidents.</strong> In the US,
recreational boaters <a
href="https://uscgboating.org/recreational-boaters/accident-reporting.php">must
notify state authorities</a> soon after any incident involving a death,
serious injury, disappearance, or substantial damage. The authorities
relay those notifications to the Coast Guard, which stores them in its
centralized <a
href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhsuscgpia-011-boating-accident-report-database-bard">Boating
Accident Report Database</a>. The <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation
Project</a> (which, customary disclosure, I run) <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/uscg-boating-accident-report-database/">filed

the <a

vessels, 8,900+ deaths, and 36,000+ injuries from 2009 to 2023, although
a few states and territories withheld their incidents from disclosure.

<p><strong>Western water rights.</strong> <a

resource — in the Western United States. Drawing on <a

collected from 11 states, the <a
href="https://data.msdlive.org/records/h79e1-k3h91">harmonized
dataset</a> “provides consistent unique identifiers for each spatial
unit of water management across the domain, unique identifiers for each
water right record, and a consistent categorization scheme that puts
each water right record into one of 7 broad use categories.” Those
categories: irrigation, domestic, livestock, fish, industrial,
environmental, and other. The authors have also published a <a

<p><strong>Ballots cast.</strong> “Electronic records of actual ballots

dataset</a> representing 40.7 million (anonymous) ballots in the
November 2020 general election, spanning 352 counties across 20 states.
Each of the 160 million rows corresponds to a voter’s choice in a
particular race and indicates the precinct, legislative district, office
in question, candidate selected, and candidate’s party. The initial
release, which the authors use to analyze <a

Order Database</a> “is a comprehensive and standardized database of
evacuation orders issued by state and local government officials in
response to the hurricanes that impacted the United States between 2014
and 2023.” To build it, the authors combed through government websites,
official social media, news reports, and other sources. The database
covers 27 storms and several types of announcements: state-of-emergency
declarations, mandatory evacuations, voluntary evacuations, and the
lifting of those orders. For each announcement, the database indicates
the order type, date/time announced, date/time effective, counties
affected, and evacuation area.</p>
