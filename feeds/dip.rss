      <description>Slaveholders in Congress, pension plans, journal editors, radio on the internet, and chocolate bar reviews.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Slaveholders in Congress, pension plans, journal editors, radio on the internet, and chocolate bar reviews.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>👋 Some updates: After nearly eight (very fulfilling) years as BuzzFeed News’ data editor, I’m shifting roles there — I’ll be working part-time (for now) on a new initiative that I’m quite excited about. More details on that soonish. In the meantime, two related developments: ✨ <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/buzzfeed/jobs/3758781?gh_jid=3758781">we’re hiring a new data editor</a> ✨ (ask me about it!) and I’ve added a ✨ <a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/jobs">job board</a> ✨ to Data Is Plural (see below).</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Slaveholders in Congress.</strong> At least “1,715 members of Congress were enslavers at some point in their adult lives,” according to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/congress-slaveowners-names-list/">Washington Post investigation published Monday</a>. Reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/juliezweil">Julie Zauzmer Weil</a> began her research with a list of <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators">every person who ever served in the House or Senate</a>, filtered it to those born before 1840, and then consulted <a href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/">their biographies</a>, Census records, and other historical documents. The Post’s <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-congress-slaveowners/">public dataset</a>, the first of its kind, lists the congressmen from that era, their dates of birth, positions held in Congress, states served, dates served, and whether the Post determined they were slaveholders. For 677 of the congressmen, the Post “couldn’t reach a conclusion” and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/submit-congress-enslaved-database/">is seeking assistance from readers</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pension plans.</strong> <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/">Public Plans Data</a>, a <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/about/our-research">collaboration</a> led by Boston College professor <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/about/bios/munnell/">Alicia H. Munnell</a>, gathers extensive information about the retirement plans that state and local governments offer their employees, drawn from <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/resources/download-avs-cafrs/">those plans’ annual financial reports</a>. The project maintains a <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/public-plans-database/download-full-data-set/">range of datasets</a>, including two decades of participation and financial figures for 200+ plans that account for “95 percent of public pension membership and assets nationwide,” their investments, early payout options, and more. It also provides <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/resources/interactive-tools/">interactive tools</a> and <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/public-plans-database/api/">an API</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Radio on the internet.</strong> <a href="https://www.radio-browser.info/">Radio-browser.info</a> is “a community driven effort (like wikipedia) with the aim of collecting as many internet radio and TV stations as possible.” The 29,000+ stations span <a href="https://www.radio-browser.info/countries">200+ countries</a> and <a href="https://www.radio-browser.info/languages">280+ languages</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Civil asset forfeiture, joint military exercises, medical drug names, foundation shades, and honey bees.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Civil asset forfeiture.</strong> “Most states and the federal government have laws allowing police and prosecutors to seize and permanently keep Americans’ cash, cars, homes and other property suspected of being involved in a crime — without regard to the owners’ guilt or innocence,” the nonprofit law firm <a href="https://ij.org/about-us/">Institute for Justice</a> writes in its <a href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/">third edition of <em>Policing for Profit</em></a>, published in 2020. The report gathers and analyzes <a href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/policing-for-profit-data/">datasets on property seized in dozens of states</a> through this practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States">civil asset forfeiture</a>, and on the spending of forfeiture funds. It also examines seizures from the federal <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jmd/major-information-systems-consolidated-asset-tracking-system">Consolidated Asset Tracking System</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/afp/freedom-information-act">detailed public extracts</a> of which the Department of Justice updates quarterly. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://thewhyaxis.substack.com/p/cops-still-take-more-stuff-from-people">Cops still take more stuff from people than burglars do</a>” (The Why Axis, 2021), and “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2014/09/06/stop-and-seize/">Stop and Seize</a>” (Washington Post, 2014).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Joint military exercises.</strong> Jordan Bernhardt’s <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HXQFHU">Joint Military Exercises Dataset</a> describes 5,000+ such operations undertaken between 1977 and 2016, drawn from historical news reports. The dataset lists each exercise’s name, location, when it began and ended, the countries that participated, activities involved, and more. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.brandonkinne.com/">Brandon J. Kinne</a>’s <a href="https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/defense-cooperation-agreement-dataset">Defense Cooperation Agreement Dataset</a>, a “comprehensive, human-coded dataset” covering bilateral defense treaties between 1980 and 2010.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Medical drug names.</strong> To build their <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9nmgzttxhm/1">International Drug Dictionary</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921009768">Mohammad A. Khaleel et al.</a> collected trade names and ingredient names “from open access websites belonging to official drug regulatory agencies, official healthcare systems, or recognized scientific bodies from 44 countries around the world,” among other sources. Each of the 450,000+ entries maps a name to standardized ingredient information from the National Library of Medicine’s <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html">RxNorm</a> database.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Foundation shades.</strong> For “<a href="https://pudding.cool/2021/03/foundation-names/">The Naked Truth</a>,” a Pudding article published last year with <a href="https://ofunneamaka.com/about-ofunneamaka/">Ofunne Amaka</a>, <a href="https://amber.rbind.io/">Amber Thomas</a> scraped <a href="https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/foundation-names">information about 6,800+ foundation shades</a> from the websites of two major cosmetics retailers. The project’s datasets identify each product’s name, description, URL, and the predominant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">HSL</a> color value in its swatch image.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Honey bees.</strong> Since the 1980s, the US Department of Agriculture has <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Bee_and_Honey/">conducted</a> an annual <a href="https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/hd76s004z?locale=en">Bee and Honey Inquiry Survey</a>, which generates estimates of “the number of colonies producing honey, yield per colony, honey production, average price, price by color class and value as well as honey stocks at the state and national levels.” Since 2016, it has also published <a href="https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/rn301137d?locale=en">annual reports that examine the gain and loss of colonies</a>, including losses due to <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/oc/br/ccd/index/">colony collapse disorder</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Local mortality and the 1918 pandemic.</strong> <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zf6wy/">Martin Eiermann, Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, et al.</a> have conducted an analysis of deaths before, during, and after the 1918 influenza pandemic, drawing on “data from multiple sources, including digitized mortality records for 70 U.S. cities, linked census records that establish urban residency status across multiple censuses” and newspaper accounts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-pharmaceutical_intervention_(epidemiology)">non-pharmaceutical interventions</a>. The team’s <a href="https://osf.io/njghd/">published files</a> includes a dataset that, for each city-and-year, lists the mortality rate overall, for white vs. non-white residents, and due to flu/pneumonia; a range of demographic variables; the timing of certain interventions; and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Religious congregations.</strong> The <a href="https://www.thearda.com/">Association of Religion Data Archives</a>, founded in 1997, “strives to democratize access to the best data on religion.” Among <a href="https://www.thearda.com/Archive/browse.asp">its resources</a> are <a href="https://www.thearda.com/Archive/NCS.asp">four waves of the National Congregations Study</a>, a <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/ncsweb/">Duke University–based survey</a> that <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/ncsweb/methodology/">asks US religious establishments</a> about their denominational affiliation, buildings of worship, congregants, staffing, educational offerings, and more. Representatives from 5,300+ Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, and other congregations participated in the latest wave, conducted in 2018–19.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>COVID-era news layoffs.</strong> “At least 6,154 news organization workers, which includes both editorial and non-editorial staffers, were laid off beginning March 2020 through August 2021,” according to a <a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/more-than-6150-news-workers-laid-off.php">new report</a> from the <a href="https://towcenter.columbia.edu/">Tow Center</a>’s <a href="https://twitter.com/__gabbymiller">Gabby Miller</a>. An <a href="https://www.cjr.org/widescreen/covid-cutback-tracker.php">interactive tracker</a> provides a map and downloadable table of the layoffs and other cutbacks, listing each outlet’s name, medium, owner, and location; the cutback’s date, description, and category (layoffs, pay cuts, etc.); and source links. <strong>Related</strong>: The Washington Post Magazine’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/interactive/2021/local-news-deserts-expanding/">Lost Local News issue</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tobacco habits.</strong> Every few years since 1992, the <a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/">National Cancer Institute</a> has sponsored the <a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/tcrb/tus-cps">Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey</a>, <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/about/supplemental-surveys.html">administered by the US Census Bureau</a>. In addition to extensive demographic information, the supplement asks about historical tobacco usage (“Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?”), preferences (“Do you usually smoke menthol or non-menthol cigarettes?”), purchasing habits, e-cigarettes, and much more. Anonymized responses and documentation <a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/tcrb/tus-cps/questionnaires-data">are available</a> for all survey waves through 2018–19. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/">The CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-09-14-edition/">DIP 2016.09.14</a>).

<p><strong>Working hours.</strong> Political scientist <a href="https://www.magnusbrasmussen.com/">Magnus Bergli Rasmussen</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/RasmussenMagnus/status/1465629029982158848">compiled data</a> on the regulation of laborers’ total work hours in nearly every country since 1789, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ie1zvkr7iht2i1j/public_workingtimedata.dta?dl=0">available as a Stata file</a>. For each year and territory, the dataset indicates whether such laws existed, the “normal” number of contractually-obligated weekly hours, the maximum number of hours allowed, and increases in pay for overtime. <strong>Read more</strong>: “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356063579_The_Great_Standardization_Working_Hours_around_the_World">The Great Standardization: Working Hours Around the World</a>,” in which Rasmussen describes the dataset’s construction.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Faster-turnaround mortality data.</strong> Last week, the CDC began publishing <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html">provisional US mortality statistics for 2018 to the near-present</a>. The data are <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html">based on death certificates</a> and can be queried by location, timing, demographics, and causes of death. They’re similar to the CDC’s <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html">non-provisional statistics for earlier years</a>, but “with a lag of just a few weeks” instead of more than a year, <a href="https://coviddatadispatch.com/2021/12/12/new-cdc-mortality-data-real-time-public-health-surveillance-at-a-highly-granular-level/">writes</a> the <a href="https://coviddatadispatch.com/">COVID-19 Data Dispatch</a>’s <a href="https://betsyladyzhets.com/">Betsy Ladyzhets</a>. <strong>Read more</strong>: “<a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2021/dec/09/the-cdc-just-released-new-data-on-deaths-in-the-us/">Researchers say the US is undercounting COVID deaths.

<p><strong>Citizenship laws.</strong> The <a href="https://globalcit.eu/">Global Citizenship Observatory</a>’s new <a href="https://globalcit.eu/databases/globalcit-citizenship-law-dataset/">Citizenship Law Dataset</a> “outlines, in a systematic way, 28 ways in which citizenship can be acquired and 15 ways in which citizenship can be lost.” <a href="https://twitter.com/GlobalCIT_EUI/status/1466362913019596803">Launched last week</a> and <a href="https://globalcit.eu/a-new-globalcit-citizenship-law-dataset-what-why-and-how/">building on the observatory’s previous work</a>, it covers the laws in effect in 190 countries in January 2020. For each mode of acquisition or loss in each jurisdiction, the dataset points to the legal citations, specifies the type of procedure (discretionary, automatic, etc.), and describes the relevant conditions (for instance, wedlock requirements for citizenship-by-descent). <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://macimide.maastrichtuniversity.nl/dual-cit-database/">Dual citizenship policies</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-01-09-edition/">DIP 2019.01.09</a>).

<p><strong>Carbon credits.</strong> The <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/faculty-and-impact/centers/cepp/projects/berkeley-carbon-trading-project/offsets-database">Voluntary Registry Offsets Database</a>, a collaboration between the <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/faculty-and-impact/centers/cepp/projects/berkeley-carbon-trading-project">Berkeley Carbon Trading Project</a> and <a href="https://carbon-direct.com/">Carbon Direct</a>, “contains all carbon offset projects, credit issuances, and credit retirements listed globally by four major voluntary offset project registries,” accounting for “almost all of the world’s voluntary market offsets.” Updated in September with data through early May 2021, the database covers 5,000+ projects and 1.2 billion credits issued. Each credit purportedly offsets a metric tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but the Berkeley team is skeptical: “Research performed by us and others has found that many, if not most, offset credits traded on the market today do not represent real emissions reductions.” <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/map_data">The World Bank’s database of carbon pricing initiatives</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Toxic pollution.</strong> Last week, ProPublica published what it’s calling “<a href="https://projects.propublica.org/toxmap/">the most detailed map of cancer-causing industrial air pollution in the U.S.</a>,” along with an <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/toxmap-poison-in-the-air">investigation</a> based on the map’s revelations. In a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-created-the-most-detailed-map-ever-of-cancer-causing-industrial-air-pollution">methodology article</a>, reporters explain how they analyzed billions of rows of data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/rsei">Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators model</a>, which “takes a variety of inputs, including emissions data, weather modeling, and facility specific information, and puts out estimated concentrations of toxic chemicals in the air around industrial facilities.” The EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/rsei/ways-get-rsei-results">publishes the model’s output</a> as bulk downloads, in an online dashboard, and in other formats. <strong>Related</strong>: The model incorporates information from the EPA’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program">Toxics Release Inventory</a>, which <a href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/find-understand-and-use-tri">publishes</a> self-reported emissions data from <a href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-threshold-screening-tool">certain mandated industrial facilities</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Campsite reservations.</strong> The US government’s <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/">Recreation Information Database</a> “represents an authoritative source of information and services for millions of visitors to federal lands, historic sites, museums, and other attractions/resources.” It provides <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/download">bulk data</a> and <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/docs">an API</a> describing recreational areas, campgrounds, campsites, permit entrances, scheduled tours, and more.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Internet shutdowns, concealed carry licensing, Amazon search results, FOIA reading rooms, and spiders.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Internet shutdowns.</strong> A <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton-faq/">coalition</a> organized by <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/about-us/">Access Now</a>, a nonprofit that “defends and extends the digital rights of users at risk around the world,” has been gathering <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/">data on intentional internet shutdowns</a>. It has identified 155 shutdowns in 2020 and 50 in January–May 2021, based on information from a range of sources, including news reports and other trackers, such as the India-focused <a href="https://internetshutdowns.in/">internetshutdowns.in</a>. The datasets indicate the type of shutdown, start and end dates, geographic scope, who ordered it, public justifications, affected networks, and more. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/10/15/internet-shutdowns-have-become-a-weapon-of-repressive-regimes">Internet shutdowns have become a weapon of repressive regimes</a>” (The Economist).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Concealed carry licenses.</strong> To construct his <a href="https://socsteidley.com/2021/10/13/introducing-the-concealed-carry-weapons-license-database/">Concealed Carry Weapons License Database</a>, sociologist <a href="https://socsteidley.com/">Trent Steidley</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/socsteidley/status/1448489666605240322">spent</a> “over a year collecting data from 28 states using public records requests and cleaning into a state and county-year format.” The <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/149062/version/V1/view?path=/openicpsr/149062/fcr:versions/V1&amp;type=project">published files</a> include the raw data, cleaned data, and documentation. The details vary by state, but can include the number of licenses held, issued, denied, revoked, and/or suspended, among other statuses; in some instances, the numbers are also disaggregated by demographic. For most states, the records stretch back to the early 2000s, some even earlier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Amazon search results.</strong> A <a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products">recent Markup investigation</a> “found that Amazon places products from its house brands and products exclusive to the site ahead of those from competitors — even competitors with higher customer ratings and more sales, judging from the volume of reviews.” Reporters <a href="https://adriannejeffries.com/">Adrianne Jeffries</a> and <a href="https://www.leonyin.org/">Leon Yin</a> published <a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/how-we-analyzed-amazons-treatment-of-its-brands-in-search-results">their methodology</a>, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-amazon-brands">underlying code and data</a>, which includes product-placement information relating 12,000+ search queries, details about 157,000+ products, raw HTML, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FOIA reading rooms.</strong> Data librarian <a href="https://twitter.com/ldeluca1101">Lisa DeLuca</a> has compiled a <a href="https://library.shu.edu/FOIA-Libraries">spreadsheet of 300+ Freedom of Information Act libraries</a>, the online reading rooms where federal agencies <a href="https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-guide-2004-edition-foia-reading-rooms">must post</a> certain records, including those that “are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records.” DeLuca’s spreadsheet, <a href="https://works.bepress.com/lisa_deluca/40/">originally published in 2019</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ldeluca1101/status/1453776389941960708">updated last week</a>, lists the agency’s name, its parent agency, and the portal’s name and URL.

<p><strong>Spiders.</strong> The <a href="https://wsc.nmbe.ch/">World Spider Catalog</a> is “the first fully searchable online database covering spider taxonomy,” with a <a href="https://wsc.nmbe.ch/dataresources">bulk dataset</a> that lists <a href="https://wsc.nmbe.ch/statistics/">49,000+ species</a>, their geographic distributions, and author-year citations. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baab064/6397506">Stano Pekár et al.</a>’s <a href="https://spidertraits.sci.muni.cz/">World Spider Trait database</a> <a href="https://spidertraits.sci.muni.cz/about">collates</a> “individual measurements, observations, or composite characteristics,” such as body length, web diameter, and number of egg sacs produced.</p>
