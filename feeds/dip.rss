<p><em>👋 On Monday I launched the <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation
Project</a>, a new initiative to identify, obtain, reformat, clean,
document, publish, and disseminate government datasets of public
interest. I invite you to <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/about">read more about
it</a>, <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests">see
the first batch of FOIA requests</a>, and <a

the project’s newsletter</a>. Questions and feedback very much
welcome!</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FDA inspections.</strong> The US Food and Drug
Administration’s <a
href="https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/cd/inspections.htm">inspections
dashboard</a> lists 264,000+ assessments of facilities (primarily those
manufacturing food, drugs, and other FDA-regulated products) and
227,000+ problems the inspectors found. The fields include the facility
owner, location, product type, inspection completion date, and outcomes.
The records, which go back to fiscal year 2009, can be bulk-downloaded
from the dashboard and queried via <a
href="https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/api/index.htm">an API</a>. They
come with certain caveats; they exclude, for instance, “inspections
waiting for a final enforcement action” and those conducted by state
(rather than federal) inspectors. <strong>Related</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Academic citations.</strong> Since 2017, the <a
href="https://i4oc.org/">Initiative for Open Citations</a> has <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21800">urged academic
publishers</a> to share their papers’ reference lists as open data. Last
month, the group <a
href="https://twitter.com/i4oc_org/status/1560274192620085251">announced</a>
it had <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02926-y">hit
a major milestone</a>: Of the 61 million papers that have references and
are indexed by <a

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Labor turnover, biodiversity trends, probabilistic predictions,
working artists, and Atari emails.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Labor turnover.</strong> The US Bureau of Labor Statistics’
monthly <a href="https://www.bls.gov/jlt/">Job Openings and Labor
Turnover Survey</a> estimates the number of jobs that people quit, how
many people were fired or laid off, the number of new hires, and the
current number of open positions. Those estimates, based on data <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/jlt/data.htm">gathered from a sample
of businesses across the country</a>, are available to <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/jlt/data.htm">download and query</a> by state,
industry, and business size. They <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/jlt/jltdef.htm">include most types of
workers</a>, regardless of whether they’re full-time or part-time,
permanent or seasonal, salaried or hourly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Biodiversity trends.</strong> <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12729">Maria
Dornelas et al.</a>’s <a
href="https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/">BioTIME</a> project has
collected and standardized data from hundreds of studies examining
ecological communities over time. You can <a
href="https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/download.php">browse and search
the studies</a> by year, taxa, species, and biome. You can also <a
href="https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/downloadFull.php">download the
full dataset</a>, which provides information about each study (biome,
start/end years, number of species tallied, and much more) and each
sample collected (date, location, species, abundance, and biomass).

<p><strong>Probabilistic predictions.</strong> <a
href="https://www.metaculus.com/about/">Metaculus</a> is a forecasting
platform whose community has registered <a
href="https://twitter.com/fianxu/status/1569537658103431168">more than 1
million predictions</a> on questions such as “<a
href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/10004/german-nuclear-power/">Will
a major nuclear power plant in Germany be operational on June 1,
2023?</a>” The <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/api2/">website’s

aspects of the platform. For each question, you can see its phrasing,
date posed, creator, prediction type, the distribution of predictions,
and more. <strong>Related</strong>: <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Working artists.</strong> The <a

<p><strong>Atari emails.</strong> A couple of decades ago, <a

mail messages</a> from his time as a video game hardware engineer at
Atari (and Atari Games, a successor company). In 2017, with Margolin’s
permission, <a href="https://twitter.com/voberoi">Vikram Oberoi</a>
scraped the 4,000+ emails and built <a

of voter identification requirements around the world</a>. For each
country and US state, the dataset indicates the type of identification
needed to vote (a photo ID, non-photo ID, or just basic personal

that summarize the test results</a>, aggregated into geospatial tiles.
(The tile sizes vary by latitude but measure roughly 2,000 feet by 2,000

tests performed and devices tested, plus the average download speed,
upload speed, and latency. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

the <a href="https://gss.norc.org/pages/GSS50.aspx">50th anniversary</a>
of the <a href="https://gss.norc.org/">General Social Survey</a>, which
<a href="https://gss.norc.org/About-The-GSS">calls itself</a> “the only
full-probability, personal-interview survey designed to monitor changes
in both social characteristics and attitudes currently being conducted
in the United States.” It combines a “standard core of demographic,
behavioral, and attitudinal questions” with shorter-lived modules on
topics such as religion, gun control, and mental health. You can <a

Luftwaffe locations, and a fern tree of life.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>👋 A reader recently asked what criteria I use to evaluate
datasets for DIP. I’ve received similar questions in the past, so I
decided to write an FAQ-style public response, which you can <a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/faq/criteria/">find here</a>. It’s
a rough draft; feedback very much welcome.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Billion-dollar disasters.</strong> As “the Nation’s
Scorekeeper in terms of addressing severe weather and climate events in
their historical perspective,” the US <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/">National Centers for Environmental
Information</a> maintains an <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/">inventory of the most
costly such disasters in the US</a> — those that have caused at least $1
billion in estimated direct losses. The quarterly-updated dataset
contains more than 330 severe storms, floods, droughts, wildfires,
freezes, and other extreme events since 1980. You can <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events">download,
filter, and sort the list</a> (by disaster type, start/end dates,
inflation-adjusted cost, and total deaths), as well as <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/mapping">map</a>, <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/time-series">chart</a>,
and <a

it. [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Business formations.</strong> To compile its <a
href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html">Business Formation
Statistics</a>, the US Census Bureau <a
href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/methodology.html">analyzes several
sources</a>, including every application to the IRS for an Employer
Identification Number (EIN) and those applicants’ first payroll tax
filings. This allows the Bureau to provide monthly counts of business
applications and formations by <a
href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/about_the_data.html">business
type</a>, industrial sector, and state. They also publish weekly
datasets of application counts by state and an annual dataset that
drills down to individual counties; both, however, lack business
formation counts and other details <a
href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/about_the_data.html">found only in
the monthly files</a>. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Attempted repairs.</strong> The <a
href="https://openrepair.org/">Open Repair Alliance</a>, “an
international group of organisations committed to working towards a
world where electrical and electronic products are more durable and
easier to repair,” is developing <a
href="https://openrepair.org/open-data/open-standard/">an open standard
for sharing data about those repairs</a>. So far, they’ve <a
href="https://openrepair.org/open-data/downloads/">gathered 62,000+
records from five partners</a>. Each entry represents a repair session:
its date and country, the product’s brand and <a
href="https://standard.openrepair.org/standard.html#product-category-values">category</a>,
the repair status, a description of the problem, barriers to repair, and
more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Luftwaffe locations.</strong> Data scientist <a
href="https://scweiss.blogspot.com/">Sam Weiss</a> has constructed a <a
href="https://github.com/samcarlos/luftwaffe_locations">dataset tracking
the World War II movements of the Luftwaffe</a>, Nazi Germany’s air
force. The information, scraped and geocoded from the Luftwaffe-history
website <a href="https://ww2.dk/">ww2.dk</a>, includes monthly locations
and aggregate statistics (total size, additions, losses) by aircraft
type and unit. <strong>Read more</strong>: A <a

<p><strong>Recessions and expansions.</strong> The US has no official
definition of a recession, but many observers look to the
non-governmental <a href="https://www.nber.org/about-nber">National
Bureau of Economic Research</a>, whose <a
href="https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating">Business
Cycle Dating Committee</a> tries to determine “the dates of peaks and
troughs that frame economic recessions and expansions.” The committee <a
href="https://www.nber.org/research/data/us-business-cycle-expansions-and-contractions">publishes
a table and data files</a> listing those dates for dozens of cycles
since the mid-1800s. But <a
href="https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating/business-cycle-dating-procedure-frequently-asked-questions">be
prepared to wait</a>: “Our determination of the trough date in April
2020 occurred 15 months after that date, in July 2021. Earlier
determinations took between 4 and 21 months.” [h/t <a

<p><strong>Consumer finances.</strong> Every three years since 1983, the

questions about their income, savings, assets, pensions, loans, credit
lines, demographics, and more. “No other study for the country collects
comparable information,” according to the Fed. The <a

<p><strong>Young adult migration.</strong> Researchers at Harvard
University and the Census Bureau have linked federal tax filings, Census
records, and other government data to track the <a
href="https://migrationpatterns.org/">migration patterns of young US
residents</a>. Specifically, for each person born in the US between 1984
and 1992, the researchers compared where they lived at age 16 to where
they lived at age 26. The project’s public dataset counts the
approximate number who moved to/from each pair of <a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-01-19-edition/">commuting
zones</a> — overall and disaggregated by race/ethnicity and parental
income level. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a

economic connectedness (friendships between low-income and high-income
users), cohesiveness (how often users’ friends are also friends with one
another), and civic engagement (membership in volunteer groups).

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Employee benefit plans, European cropland, Christianity in China,
data governance ratings, and diplomatic gifts.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Employee benefit plans.</strong> US companies that offer
their employees a retirement plan, such as a pension or 401(k), must
report the particulars of those plans through <a
href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/employers-and-advisers/plan-administration-and-compliance/reporting-and-filing/form-5500">Form
5500</a> — a creation of the IRS, Department of Labor, and <a
href="https://www.pbgc.gov/">Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</a>.
Employers offering health plans, vacation, or other welfare benefits to
100+ workers must typically report those, too. The Department of Labor
publishes <a
href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/public-disclosure/foia/form-5500-datasets">datasets
with details from all Form 5500 submissions</a> going back to 1999, as
well as a <a href="https://www.efast.dol.gov/5500search/">search
tool</a> that goes back to 2010. <strong>Related</strong>: Through a
FOIA request, <a href="https://dan-bauman.com/">Dan Bauman</a> has <a
href="https://github.com/danbauman77/tophat">obtained decades of
metadata on 80,000+ “top hat” statements</a>, which <a
href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/about-ebsa/about-us/erisa-advisory-council/2020-examining-top-hat-plan-participation-and-reporting.pdf">concern
plans</a> “providing deferred compensation for a select group of
management or highly compensated employees.” [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>European cropland.</strong> <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08151">Maja Schneider et al.</a>’s <a
href="https://github.com/maja601/EuroCrops">EuroCrops</a> project
combines “all publicly available self-declared crop reporting datasets
from countries of the European Union.” So far, that universe corresponds
to the entirety or parts of 16 countries. The project’s datasets include
various attributes from the original data files, geographic coordinates
for each agricultural parcel, and each parcel’s primary crop type, which
the authors have standardized using a taxonomy they devised.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Christianity in China.</strong> The <a
href="https://chcdatabase.com/">China Historical Christian Database</a>,
a project based at Boston University’s School of Theology, spans the
years 1550 to 1950. Launched <a
href="https://www.bu.edu/cgcm/2022/07/19/11962/">last week</a>, it
provides “tools to discover where every Christian church, school,
hospital, orphanage, publishing house, and the like were located in
China,” plus “who worked inside those buildings, both foreign and
Chinese.” The database, available to <a
href="https://github.com/chcdatabase/data">download</a> and <a

href="https://chcdatabase.github.io/data-documentation/">describes</a>
33,000+ people, 7,000+ organizations, the relationships between those
entities, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Data governance ratings</strong>. A <a
href="https://datagovhub.letsnod.com/">new report</a> from George
Washington University’s <a
href="https://datagovhub.elliott.gwu.edu/">Digital Trade and Data
Governance Hub</a> rates 68 countries on their approaches to data
governance. It scores each country on 26 indicators across 6 categories
— for instance, whether it has a personal data protection law, publishes
an open data portal, and/or says it adheres to the <a
href="https://oecd.ai/en/ai-principles">OECD AI Principles</a>.

<p><strong>Diplomatic gifts.</strong> Federal employees are <a
href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7342">not supposed to
accept major gifts</a> from foreign governments. But exceptions occur,
such as “when it appears that to refuse the gift would likely cause
offense or embarrassment,” and agencies must annually report those
exceptions in the Federal Register. In 2020, <a
href="https://www.alexcookson.com/about/">Alex Cookson</a> <a
href="https://www.alexcookson.com/post/what-can-we-learn-from-diplomatic-gifts/">fetched

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Wildfires around the world, hospital price lists, monkeypox
strains, startup factories, and shark incidents.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Wildfires around the world.</strong> The <a
href="https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">Global Wildfire Information
System</a>, expanding on the work of <a
href="https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">European Forest Fire Information
System</a>, uses satellite data to provide <a
href="https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/apps/gwis.statistics/">weekly and
annual estimates</a> of the number of fires and area burned in 200+
countries. Its <a
href="https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/apps/country.profile/downloads">bulk
data</a> indicates monthly burned hectares by country, sub-country unit,
and land type from 2002 to 2019, as well as the boundaries of individual
fires from 2001 to 2020. It also publishes <a
href="https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/applications/data-and-services">gridded
spatial data</a> relating to fire danger forecasts, active fires,
emissions, and more. <strong>As seen in</strong>: <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hospital price lists.</strong> Since January 2021, the US
government <a href="https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency">has
required hospitals to publish</a> machine-readable files listing the
standard charges for all items and services they provide. But there’s no
standard format for these price lists (also known as “chargemasters”),
no official central repository of them, and <a
href="https://www.patientrightsadvocate.org/semi-annual-compliance-report-2022">compliance
has been lacking</a>. Seeing those problems, the versioned-data platform
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a> earlier this year ran a
<a
href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-04-22-hospital-price-transparency-retrospective/">paid
crowdsourcing campaign</a> that pulled <a
href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-07-01-hospitals-compliance/">nearly
300 million prices from the published lists of roughly 1,800
hospitals</a> into a <a
href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-price-transparency-v3">single
database</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: Thanks to an <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Monkeypox strains.</strong> <a
href="https://nextstrain.org/">Nextstrain</a>, “an open-source project
to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome
data,” has begun analyzing <a
href="https://nextstrain.org/monkeypox/hmpxv1">genetic sequences from
hundreds of monkeypox virus samples</a>, the vast majority from
infections in the past few months. The project provides metadata on each
sample, including the date, country, variant, and mutation metrics, as
well as detailed sequencing data <a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide&amp;VirusLineage_ss=Monkeypox%20virus,%20taxid:10244">from
