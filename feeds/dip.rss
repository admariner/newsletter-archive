<p> </p>
<p><strong>H-1B lotteries.</strong> A <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-staffing-firms-game-h1b-visa-lottery-system/">recent
Bloomberg News investigation</a> into the US government’s annual H-1B
lottery, a key step in allocating the country’s skilled-worker visas,
finds that “thousands of companies got an unfair advantage by helping
themselves to extra lottery tickets.” To reach those conclusions, the
team “obtained data on all H-1B lottery registrations, selections, and
petitions for fiscal years 2021 through 2024 after bringing a lawsuit
against the Department of Homeland Security under the Freedom of
Information Act.” They’ve <a
href="https://github.com/BloombergGraphics/2024-h1b-immigration-data">shared
the records</a>, which indicate each registration’s employer, as well as
the proposed beneficiary’s gender, nationality, and birth year. For
registrations that led to visa petitions, the data include additional
details, such as the worksite, salary, job title, and beneficiary’s
field of study. [h/t <a

and assessments of those domains’ popularity. The platform’s “Media
Monitor” feature, although not downloadable, links to news articles and
other webpages mentioning the companies. [h/t <a

href="https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/4ec7019fe63944bf87d40d2cdfa0d686/">dataset
of residential water demand and supply in California</a> includes the
monthly volumes of water produced/sold by 404 of the state’s water
suppliers, covering 2013–2021. The researchers extracted, standardized,
and cleaned the data from the state’s <a
href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/ear.html">mandatory
annual reports</a>, which collect thousands of data points from each
supplier. They also added contextual information, such as climatic data
(monthly local precipitation, temperature, and <a

<p><strong>UK grantmakers.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.ukgrantmaking.org/">UK Grantmaking initiative</a> “is
a unique cross-sector collaboration between” <a
href="https://www.ukgrantmaking.org/partners/">several major
organizations in the field</a>. Their <a
href="https://www.ukgrantmaking.org/report/2024/methodology-data/#Full%20data">downloadable
dataset</a> provides information about 12,000+ trusts, foundations,
charities, and other grantmakers for financial year 2022-23, <a
href="https://www.ukgrantmaking.org/report/2024-06/methodology-data/">based
on records</a> from government regulators. The dataset lists each
organization’s name, government-assigned ID, location, category,
registration date, income, spending totals, net assets, and more.

<p><strong>Olympic medalists.</strong> The <a

Network</a>’s <a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/">Giorgio Comai</a> has
used Wikipedia and Wikidata to create a <a

listing the name, birth date, sex, and birthplace of Summer Olympic
medalists. Comai has <a

the birthplace coordinates and, for Europe-born medalists, linked them
to their <a

<p><strong>The Freedman’s Bank.</strong> The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman%27s_Savings_Bank">Freedman’s
Savings and Trust Company</a> was chartered by Congress in 1865, toward
the end of the Civil War, to provide banking services to formerly
enslaved Americans. “Though the bank achieved some early successes, it
failed catastrophically in 1874, destroying the savings of a broad swath
of newly freed black citizens,” write <a
href="https://www.malcolmwardlaw.info/">Malcolm Wardlaw</a> and <a
href="https://www.virginiatraweek.com/">Virginia Traweek</a>, who have
<a href="https://freedmansbank.uga.edu/">constructed several
datasets</a> based on handwritten records preserved by the federal
government. One dataset lists <a
href="https://freedmansbank.uga.edu/project/passbooks/">5,000+
transactions</a> from 500+ accounts’ “passbooks”, indicating the account
holder, city, transaction type, date, and amount. Another lists <a
href="https://freedmansbank.uga.edu/project/dividendrecord/">40,000+
accounts’ final balances</a> at the time of the bank’s failure.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Recreational boating accidents.</strong> In the US,
recreational boaters <a
href="https://uscgboating.org/recreational-boaters/accident-reporting.php">must
notify state authorities</a> soon after any incident involving a death,
serious injury, disappearance, or substantial damage. The authorities
relay those notifications to the Coast Guard, which stores them in its
centralized <a
href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhsuscgpia-011-boating-accident-report-database-bard">Boating
Accident Report Database</a>. The <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation
Project</a> (which, customary disclosure, I run) <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/uscg-boating-accident-report-database/">filed
a FOIA request</a> for the database and, earlier this week, <a

the <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/uscg-boating-accident-report-database/">records
it received</a>. The data describe 58,000+ boating accidents, 78,000+
vessels, 8,900+ deaths, and 36,000+ injuries from 2009 to 2023, although
a few states and territories withheld their incidents from disclosure.

<p><strong>Western water rights.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03434-6">Matthew D.
Lisk et al.</a> have compiled and standardized a <a
href="https://data.msdlive.org/records/dfkx0-hew78">dataset of water
rights records</a> — key documents in the allocation of the scarce
resource — in the Western United States. Drawing on <a
href="https://data.msdlive.org/records/8y9nq-bdt52">raw data</a>
collected from 11 states, the <a
href="https://data.msdlive.org/records/h79e1-k3h91">harmonized
dataset</a> “provides consistent unique identifiers for each spatial
unit of water management across the domain, unique identifiers for each
water right record, and a consistent categorization scheme that puts
each water right record into one of 7 broad use categories.” Those
categories: irrigation, domestic, livestock, fish, industrial,
environmental, and other. The authors have also published a <a
href="https://data.msdlive.org/records/v5ree-qj344">set of shapefiles
outlining each water management area’s boundaries</a>.</p>

create a central portal (similar to that in the UK) to collate this
information, such a database does not exist yet,” writes <a

<p><strong>Ballots cast.</strong> “Electronic records of actual ballots
cast (cast vote records) are available to the public in some
jurisdictions,” <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=10404813&amp;version=1.0">Shiro
Kuriwaki et al.</a> write. “However, they have been released in a
variety of formats and have not been independently evaluated.” So the
researchers have <a
href="https://github.com/kuriwaki/cvr_harvard-mit_scripts">constructed</a>
a <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PQQ3KV">standardized
dataset</a> representing 40.7 million (anonymous) ballots in the
November 2020 general election, spanning 352 counties across 20 states.
Each of the 160 million rows corresponds to a voter’s choice in a
particular race and indicates the precinct, legislative district, office
in question, candidate selected, and candidate’s party. The initial
release, which the authors use to analyze <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-ticket_voting">ticket-splitting</a>
patterns, <a
href="https://x.com/shirokuriwaki/status/1816213954194202733">covers</a>
votes for president, Senate, House, governor, and state legislature.

<p><strong>Hurricane evacuation orders.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03100-x">Harsh Anand et
al.</a>’s <a href="https://www.hurrevacorder.info/">Hurricane Evacuation
Order Database</a> “is a comprehensive and standardized database of
evacuation orders issued by state and local government officials in
response to the hurricanes that impacted the United States between 2014
and 2023.” To build it, the authors combed through government websites,
official social media, news reports, and other sources. The database
covers 27 storms and several types of announcements: state-of-emergency
declarations, mandatory evacuations, voluntary evacuations, and the
lifting of those orders. For each announcement, the database indicates
the order type, date/time announced, date/time effective, counties
affected, and evacuation area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Scholarship, networked.</strong> <a
href="https://openalex.org/">OpenAlex</a>, “a free and open catalog of
the global research system,” has compiled data on more than 250 million
scholarly works — and has linked those works to <a

Statistics’ <a href="https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm">NLSY79
survey</a> has interviewed the same people dozens of times since 1979.
It began with a “nationally representative sample of 12,686 young men
and women”; more than four decades later, <a
href="https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy79/intro-to-the-sample/retention-reasons-noninterview">6,000+

of topics</a>, including education, employment, health, dating,
marriage, children, attitudes, and substance abuse. Public-use data are

<p><strong>Human rights scores.</strong> The <a

href="https://cirights.com/learn-about-the-cirights-project/">aims</a>
“to create numerical measures for every internationally recognized human
right for all countries of the world.” The team has developed a <a
href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4625036">detailed
guide</a> to scoring each government’s record on <a
href="https://cirights.com/rights-we-score/">dozens of such rights</a>,
such as freedom of religion, women’s political rights, freedom from
extrajudicial killings, the right to a fair trial, and “reasonable
limits” on working hours. For each year from 1981 to 2021, the project’s
scorers have rated each country on each right, generally on a
three-point scale, based on information in the US State Department’s <a
href="https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/">Country
Reports on Human Rights Practices</a>, <a
href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/annual-report-archive/">Amnesty
International’s annual reports</a>, and similar sources. The resulting
dataset includes those scores, as well as several summary metrics.</p>

Jeong et al.</a> have constructed a <a
href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Commercial_Boundary/24654309/4">dataset</a>
estimating the geographic boundaries of 23,000+ commercial zones in 69
metro areas in the US and Canada. To build it, they <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03275-3/tables/1">used
data</a> on retail and office locations from <a

and the street at its centroid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>National park species.</strong> The National Park Service’s
<a href="https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/">NPSpecies portal</a>
“documents our knowledge about the occurrence and status of species” on
the agency’s lands. For each NPS-managed area, you can download a list
of the species, their scientific and common names, occurrence status
(present, probably present, unconfirmed), nativeness, conservation
status, and more. <strong>Related</strong>: Noting that “many of the
observations in NPSpecies remain unverified and the lists are often
outdated,” <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Federal inmate complaints.</strong> The Federal Bureau of
Prisons’ <a
href="https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/1330_018.pdf">Administrative
Remedy Program</a> “allow[s] an inmate to seek formal review of an issue
relating to any aspect of his/her own confinement.” In October 2022, the
<a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation
Project</a> (which, disclosure, I run) filed a FOIA request seeking
records from the agency database that tracks those complaints. In
response, BOP last month <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/federal-inmate-complaints/">provided
data</a> on 1.78 million complaint and appeal submissions filed from
January 2000 through late May 2024, spanning nearly 1 million distinct
cases. The records, <a
href="https://buttondown.email/data-liberation-project/archive/dlp-dispatch-16/">published
yesterday</a> with the help of volunteers, <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vTuyUFNqS9tex4_s4PgmhF8RTvTb-uFMN5ElDjjVHTM/edit">indicate</a>
when each filing was received, its relevant case number, complaint
subject, facility where the issue occurred, case status, status update
date, reasons for rejection/closure, and other details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Corporate AI activity.</strong> The <a
href="https://eto.tech/dataset-docs/private-sector-ai-indicators/">Private-Sector
AI Indicators dataset</a>, from Georgetown University’s <a
href="https://eto.tech/">Emerging Technology Observatory</a>, provides
“a diverse range of indicators of AI-related activity for hundreds of
companies worldwide, from startups to multinationals.” For each of the
670+ companies included, the <a
href="https://zenodo.org/records/12520760">dataset</a> counts the number
of AI-related research articles published by its employees
(disaggregated by topic), AI-related patents filed (by application area
and use-case), and workforce (overall and those estimated to be
AI-involved). It also lists each company’s main location, sector, growth
stage, and description, as well as aliases, stock listings, and
identifiers in several external data sources. <strong>See also</strong>:

<p><strong>East Asia building outlines.</strong> Recent years have seen
the development of ambitious datasets that provide the outlines of
buildings by the millions. For instance, from the archives: <a
href="https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints">buildings in
the US</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-07-18-edition/">DIP

Zealand</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-09-25-edition/">DIP
2019.09.25</a>). In the Journal of Remote Sensing, however, <a
href="https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/remotesensing.0138">Qian Shi
et al.</a> note a relative lack of such data for buildings in East Asia,
which the authors attribute “to the more complex distribution of
buildings and the scarcity of auxiliary data”. As an antidote, they’ve
generated a <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/8174931">dataset that
outlines more than 280 million buildings</a> in 2,800+ cities across
China, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, and Mongolia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>US coral reefs.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.coris.noaa.gov/monitoring/">National Coral Reef
Monitoring Program</a> collects scientific and socioeconomic/attitude
survey data related to the coral reefs offshore of the continental
United States, Hawaii, and US territories. It provides the data through

The scientific data <a

species-level coral cover, colony density, bleaching prevalence, and
disease rates; fish populations; water alkalinity and dissolved
inorganic carbon levels; and more. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Historical newswire articles.</strong> <a

created <a
href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/dell-research-harvard/newswire">Newswire</a>,
a dataset of 2.7 million newswire articles published in the US between
1878 and 1977. To build it, they extracted 138 million articles from
scans of newspapers’ front pages and then used machine learning to group
those coming “from the same underlying newswire source article, in the
presence of significant abridgement and noise.” For each detected
newswire item, the dataset lists the newspapers that carried it, dates
published, the text of a representative version, its extracted byline,
dispatch location, people mentioned in the text, general topic, and
more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Beach replenishment.</strong> The <a

beach-replenishing efforts</a> since the 1920s. The <a
href="https://beachnourishment.wcu.edu/about">project</a> is “a 25-year
research and data collection effort that, to the best of our knowledge,
represents the most comprehensive compilation of beach nourishment
history in the United States.” For each sand-adding “episode,” the
dataset <a
href="https://beachnourishment.wcu.edu/glossary">indicates</a> its
location, year completed, sand volume, length of shoreline treated,
total cost, primary type of funding source (private, federal, state,
etc.), and justification (shore protection, navigation, emergency dune
construction, etc.). <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

<p><strong>Hurricane forecast accuracy.</strong> The <a

“receives frequent inquiries on the accuracy and skill of its forecasts
and of the computer models available to it.” To help answer those
questions, the agency publishes a <a

regularly-updated verification reports</a>, as well as a <a
href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify7.shtml">database
quantifying its forecast errors</a>. For each official projection since
1970, the database <a

each storm’s predicted location and wind speed to those attributes’
ultimate values. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

<p><strong>Supreme gifts.</strong> <a
href="https://fixthecourt.com/about-us/">Fix the Court</a> is a
nonprofit that “advocates for non-ideological ‘fixes’ that would make
the federal courts, and primarily the U.S. Supreme Court, more open and
more accountable to the American people.” Earlier this month, they <a
href="https://fixthecourt.com/2024/06/a-staggering-tally-supreme-court-justices-accepted-hundreds-of-gifts-worth-millions-of-dollars/">published</a>
a <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14l25NLvBOd9sk4mArK4k7dtV0MUwxr5GBuLHL5Sp8lo/edit">series
of spreadsheets</a> tallying 500+ gifts accepted by the Supreme Court’s
justices since 2000, with an estimated total value of $4.76 million. The
findings “are largely based on last year’s groundbreaking work by
ProPublica and includes data from stories in the New York Times, L.A.
Times, the congressional record, annual disclosures,” and Fix the
Court’s own work. The data indicate each gift’s year, recipient,
description, giver, value, and the source of information.

2019.04.24</a>), “aims to answer some of the most important questions
surrounding interactions between the internet and politics.” To do so,
they conduct surveys of experts and ask them <a
href="https://digitalsocietyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSP-Codebook-v6.pdf">questions
such as</a>: “How often does the government shut down domestic access to
the Internet?” and “How often do domestic elites use social media to
organize offline political action of any kind?” The survey’s <a

cover 170+ countries and provide aggregate metrics for each question.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Interest group positions.</strong> <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly/article/chorus-a-new-dataset-of-state-interest-group-policy-positions-in-the-united-states/6827DC9EC72301016894F265777C0078">Galen
Hall et al.</a> have compiled a <a
href="https://dataverse.unc.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.15139/S3/RPU1QP">dataset</a>
of “over 13 million policy positions stated by tens of thousands of
interest groups and individuals on bills in 17 state legislatures over
the past 25 years.” The authors collected and standardized the data,
which span 1997 to 2022, from lobbying and testimony disclosures. For
each of those positions, the dataset indicates the relevant bill, client
or individual represented, representative name, position phrase
(<em>for</em>, <em>against</em>, <em>monitoring</em>,
<em>undecided</em>, etc.), the date the position was reported, and <a
href="https://github.com/galenphall/chorus_data/blob/main/CODEBOOK.md">more</a>.
It also provides details about each bill from <a

Legislatures</a>, as well as client-industry categorizations from <a

<p><strong>State tax revenues.</strong> How much money do US states
collect through different types of taxes? The Census Bureau’s <a
href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/qtax.html">Quarterly
Summary of State and Local Government Tax Revenue</a> provides these
figures every three months, going back decades. The categories include
taxes on property, income, general sales, sales of specific products
(such as tobacco, alcohol, gas, and gambling), licenses, and more. For
several years now, the agency has also published <a
href="https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/selected-monthly-state-sales-tax-collections.html">monthly
data for a subset of those taxes</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

<p><strong>NYC shelter exits.</strong> A 2022 law requires New York City
to report the monthly number of individuals and families exiting the
city’s shelter system. Unfortunately, the city publishes those reports
only as PDFs and without a historical archive. <a

the reports, and to turn them into <a

of exits for a particular city agency, family/person category, and
destination type. The latter includes various kinds of permanent
housing, transitional housing, medical facilities, as well as “unknown.”
