prisoners, mercenaries, and Roman amphitheaters.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Six decades of House primaries.</strong> In 2014, <a
href="https://www.stephenpettigrew.com/">Stephen Pettigrew</a>, <a
href="https://www.westga.edu/profile.php?emp_id=91943">Karen Owen</a>,
and <a
href="https://www.augie.edu/academics/majors-and-programs/government-and-international-affairs/political-science/faculty">Emily
Wanless</a> published a <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26448">dataset
of all Democratic and Republican primary election results</a> for the US
House of Representatives between 1956 and 2010. It indicates each
election’s year, state, redistricting status, primary system (open,
closed, semi-open, multiparty), and more. The dataset also lists each
candidate’s name, gender, prior office, and votes received. In 2020, <a
href="https://www.michaelgmiller.com/">Michael G. Miller</a> and <a
href="https://twitter.com/nickicamberg">Nicki Camberg</a> published a <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CXVMSY">follow-up
dataset</a>, adding coverage for 2012 through 2018. It uses the same
variable names and structure as the earlier dataset, so that the two
files can be easily combined.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where college grads go.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30088">Johnathan Conzelmann et
al.</a> have created a <a
href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/170381/version/V3/view">dataset</a>
that estimates the geographic distribution of recent graduates from
2,600 US colleges and universities, calculated from information on the
schools’ official LinkedIn landing pages. For each institution, the
dataset indicates the proportions of alumni in each of the 278 specific
US locations in LinkedIn’s geographic lexicon and cross-references them
with government-defined <a

<p><strong>Hong Kong political prisoners.</strong> The <a
href="https://hkdc.us/about/">Hong Kong Democracy Council</a>, a
US-based advocacy group, last month published the first version of its
<a href="https://hkdc.us/political-prisoners-latest-update/">Hong Kong
Political Prisoners Database</a>, which contains information about
1,000+ protesters, opposition leaders, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_national_security_law">national
security law</a> defendants incarcerated since the city’s pro-democracy
mass protests in mid-2019. It lists each defendant’s age, arrest date,
arrest location, conviction date, convicted offenses, sentencing date,
sentence length, and other details. An <a
href="https://hkdc.us/political-prisoners-research-report/">accompanying
report</a> describes the database’s context and methodology. [h/t <a

Petersohn et al.</a>’s <a

Military Actor Database</a> examines “the market for force” in 72
countries from 1980 to 2016. It contains information, primarily sourced
from news reports, on thousands of contractual relationships between
providers (mercenaries and private military/security companies) and
their clients (governments, opposition groups, NGOs, and transnational
corporations). The contracted work ranges “from combat services and
support services (e.g., communication, maintenance), to logistics,
security, consultancy, training, and reconstruction.”</p>

<p><strong>Roman amphitheaters.</strong> <a

<p><strong>Supercomputers.</strong> Since 1993, a <a
href="https://www.top500.org/project/authors/">team of researchers</a>
has regularly assessed the most powerful computers in the world. The
resulting <a href="https://www.top500.org/">TOP500 lists</a> are
published twice a year, in June and November, using a <a
href="https://www.top500.org/project/linpack/">performance benchmark
developed by team member Jack Dongarra</a>, who <a
href="https://www.acm.org/media-center/2022/march/turing-award-2021">became
a Turing Award laureate this year</a>. Downloadable versions indicate
each supercomputer’s name, rank, location, manufacturer, year built,
power consumption, technical specifications, and more. <strong>As seen
in</strong>: “<a
href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/the-race-to-build-the-fastest-supercomputer/">The
race to build the fastest supercomputer</a>,” by Datawrapper’s <a
href="https://twitter.com/EdurneMG">Edurne Morillo</a>, who recommends

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure permitting.</strong> The US government’s <a

those funded by the Department of Transportation and those participating
in a <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/sustainability/fast-41-coordination">voluntary
review-coordination effort known as FAST-41</a>. The dashboard’s <a
href="https://data.permits.performance.gov/Permitting-Project/Permitting-Dashboard-Full-Dataset/mcm3-xbid">full
dataset</a> describes 12,000+ milestones relating to nearly 1,000
projects, roughly half of which have been completed. Online, you can <a

<p><strong>Religion and government.</strong> To compile the <a

Religious Preference dataset</a>, researchers scrutinized primary
documents and secondary sources “for information on the existence,
origination, change, or discontinuation of a law or policy directed
toward” any of 30 religious denominations in 200+ countries. Then they
<a
href="https://www.thearda.com/archive/files/codebooks/origCB/GRP%202.0%20Codebook.pdf">assessed</a>
the degree to which those policies reflected institutional favor or
disfavor across 28 variables, themselves grouped into “five broad
components of state-religion”: <a

<p><strong>Drugs for rare diseases.</strong> The US <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_Drug_Act_of_1983">Orphan Drug
Act of 1983</a> provided <a
href="https://www.fda.gov/industry/orphan-products-development-events/story-behind-orphan-drug-act">incentives
for pharmaceutical companies</a> to develop treatments for <a
href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/rare-diseases-fda">rare diseases</a>.
The Food and Drug Administration <a
href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/office-clinical-policy-and-programs/office-orphan-products-development">reviews
applications</a> for treatments seeking this “orphan” status, decides
whether to designate them as such, and maintains a <a
href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/">database
of all 6,000+ designations since 1983</a>. The database lists each
treatment’s generic name, trade name (if any), “sponsor” company,
designated use(s), date(s) of designation, and whether/when the FDA
approved it for sale. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a

Princeton</a> research program <a
href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2022/04/25/new-scholarly-database-publicly-identifying-lgbtqi-elected-officials-across-globe">has
assembled</a> an <a

database</a> of 1,000+ officials elected since the 1970s “who publicly
identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, transgender, non-binary,
gender-non-conforming, queer or intersex.” The project focuses on
candidates elected to national, state, and mayoral offices. Entries
indicate each official’s name, country, party affiliation, level of
government, position held, year first elected, sexual and gender
identity, whether they were out when first elected, the year they came
out, and more. [h/t <a

and datasets</a>. Among them: the Severe Weather Database, which
contains all tornado reports for the contiguous US from 1950 to 2020,

each incident’s date, starting and ending locations, intensity, injury

<p><strong>Mask-wearing on NYC transit.</strong> Since June 2020, New
York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority has surveyed mask usage in
a sample of subways and at its busiest bus stops. The results, available

and <a

indicate the number of people observed (nearly 5 million so far) during
each biweekly survey cycle and the percentages of them found to be
wearing a mask correctly, incorrectly, or not at all. [h/t <a

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Earmarks, intermediate care facilities, more county-level
mortality data, alpine snow, and the meta-Dataverse.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Earmarks.</strong> The US government’s <a
href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2471">spending
bill for FY 2022</a>, enacted last month, <a
href="https://www.axios.com/congressional-earmarks-new-constraints-44b0551d-bdfc-4e1e-b465-e1d2962c90b7.html">heralded
the return</a> of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earmark_(politics)">earmarks</a>,
which were banned for a decade. This time around, Congress <a
href="https://appropriations.house.gov/transparency/fiscal-year-2022">is
publishing a set of documents</a> that describe legislators’ specific
funding requests — but <a
href="https://twitter.com/danielschuman/status/1511322851932000260">as
sideways PDFs instead of structured data</a>. So the Bipartisan Policy
Center has <a
href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/congressionally-directed-spending-fy2022-dataset/">converted
the PDFs into a spreadsheet</a> listing the 4,975 approved earmarks
within them. Bloomberg Government has also <a
href="https://about.bgov.com/news/colleges-cops-airports-among-earmark-winners-in-2022-funding/">compiled
and shared</a> a similar spreadsheet. Both files list each earmarked
project’s name, recipient, state, and price tag, as well as the
legislator(s) who made the request and the subcommittee that approved
it; BPC’s file additionally includes the location, agency,
agency-account, and legislators’ <a

<p><strong>Intermediate care facilities.</strong> In the US, <a
href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certification/CertificationandComplianc/ICFIID">intermediate
care facilities</a> provide residential, long-term care to people whose
intellectual or developmental disabilities require active treatment and
continuous supervision. On Monday, colleagues at BuzzFeed News published
an <a
href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kendalltaggart/kkr-brightspring-disability-private-equity-abuse">investigation
into one of the largest ICF owners</a>, supplemented by an <a

inspection data</a> gathered through the Centers for Medicare &amp;
Medicaid Services’ <a href="https://qcor.cms.gov/">QCOR portal</a>.
(Disclosure: I helped to write an initial version of the data-collection
code.) The records, <a

in bulk</a> for the first time, <a
href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2022-04-icf-analysis#survey-data">enumerate</a>
