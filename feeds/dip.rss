      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Earmarks, intermediate care facilities, more county-level
mortality data, alpine snow, and the meta-Dataverse.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Earmarks.</strong> The US government’s <a
href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2471">spending
bill for FY 2022</a>, enacted last month, <a
href="https://www.axios.com/congressional-earmarks-new-constraints-44b0551d-bdfc-4e1e-b465-e1d2962c90b7.html">heralded
the return</a> of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earmark_(politics)">earmarks</a>,
which were banned for a decade. This time around, Congress <a
href="https://appropriations.house.gov/transparency/fiscal-year-2022">is
publishing a set of documents</a> that describe legislators’ specific
funding requests — but <a
href="https://twitter.com/danielschuman/status/1511322851932000260">as
sideways PDFs instead of structured data</a>. So the Bipartisan Policy
Center has <a
href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/congressionally-directed-spending-fy2022-dataset/">converted
the PDFs into a spreadsheet</a> listing the 4,975 approved earmarks
within them. Bloomberg Government has also <a
href="https://about.bgov.com/news/colleges-cops-airports-among-earmark-winners-in-2022-funding/">compiled
and shared</a> a similar spreadsheet. Both files list each earmarked
project’s name, recipient, state, and price tag, as well as the
legislator(s) who made the request and the subcommittee that approved
it; BPC’s file additionally includes the location, agency,
agency-account, and legislators’ <a
href="https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/member-bioguide-ids">Bioguide
IDs</a>. [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Intermediate care facilities.</strong> In the US, <a
href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certification/CertificationandComplianc/ICFIID">intermediate
care facilities</a> provide residential, long-term care to people whose
intellectual or developmental disabilities require active treatment and
continuous supervision. On Monday, colleagues at BuzzFeed News published
an <a
href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kendalltaggart/kkr-brightspring-disability-private-equity-abuse">investigation
into one of the largest ICF owners</a>, supplemented by an <a
href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2022-04-icf-analysis">analysis of
inspection data</a> gathered through the Centers for Medicare &amp;
Medicaid Services’ <a href="https://qcor.cms.gov/">QCOR portal</a>.
(Disclosure: I helped to write an initial version of the data-collection
code.) The records, <a
href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2022-04-icf-analysis/tree/main/data/qcor">available
in bulk</a> for the first time, <a
href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2022-04-icf-analysis#survey-data">enumerate</a>
surveys conducted between 2010 and 2021, the facilities examined, and
the types of deficiencies inspectors found. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Alpine snow.</strong> <a

spanning the years 1970 to 2019. They gathered records from open data
portals and through requests to authorities in five countries,
standardized them into a consistent format, and filled in gaps where
possible. [h/t <a

news, research organizations, and teenagers on TV.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHO outbreak alerts.</strong> The World Health Organization’s
<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news">Disease
Outbreak News</a> provides “information on confirmed acute public health
events or potential events of concern,” with reports issued when those
events meet certain criteria. <a
href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.22.22272790v1">Colin
J. Carlson et al.</a> have assembled a <a
href="https://github.com/cghss/dons">dataset of all 2,700+ reports</a>
published between January 1996 and December 2019; it includes report
metadata (date and headline, for example), as well as variables drawn
from the descriptive text, such as the diseases discussed, countries
affected, case counts, whether the report implicates mass gatherings,
and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Census tract urbanization.</strong> Studies of US
urbanization often examine census tracts, but those boundaries have
changed over time and <a
href="https://twitter.com/snmarkley/status/1502268920593592321">are
relatively new</a> in <a
href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/programs/geography/tracts_and_block_numbering_areas.html">many
parts of the country</a>. To aid longitudinal analyses, <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01184-x">Scott N.
Markley et al.</a> have taken 2010’s tract boundaries and used several
techniques to estimate the number of housing units within them every
decade from 1940 to 2010, plus 2019. The <a
href="https://osf.io/fzv5e/">dataset</a> also estimates each tract’s
“urbanization year,” when it surpassed 200 units per square mile.

1970.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Local digital news.</strong> <a
href="https://www.projectnewsoasis.com/">Project Oasis</a>, which aims
to “map and showcase the growing number of locally focused digital news
publications in the U.S. and Canada,” has collected data on 700+ such
organizations. Its <a

operation, communities served, and other characteristics. A <a

2023. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Research organizations.</strong> The <a
href="https://ror.org/">Research Organization Registry</a> is “a
community-led project to develop an open, sustainable, usable, and
unique identifier for every research organization in the world.” Earlier
this month, the project <a

and <a href="https://ror.readme.io/docs/ror-data-structure">other
structured information</a> for 100,000+ organizations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Teenagers on TV.</strong> In search of “a better
understanding of the age differences between teen characters in TV shows
and the actors who portray them,” <a
href="https://amber.rbind.io/">Amber Thomas</a> last year manually
compiled <a
href="https://data.world/amberthomas/age-of-characters-and-actors-in-teen-tv-shows">data
on 240+ characters</a> in 33 series that premiered between 2000 and
2021. For each character, Thomas’s dataset lists their name, fictional
age/grade, gender, and love interests, as well as the actor’s name and
birth date.</p>

<p><strong>Prison COVID policies.</strong> Between April 2020 and April
2021, researchers at the <a href="https://uclacovidbehindbars.org/">UCLA
Law COVID Behind Bars Data Project</a> gathered 3,500+ policy
announcements from federal and state prison agencies in the US. Their <a

spreadsheet</a>, <a
href="https://uclacovidbehindbars.org/prison-policy-index">published
earlier this year</a>, describes the announcements they gathered through
April 2021. It indicates the state, date publicized, and date collected,
and provides an archival link, a short summary, and a series of columns
classifying the policies announced.</p>

<p><strong>Medieval prices.</strong> The <a

Data Bank</a>, an effort that dates back to the 1980s, contains six
datasets relating to currency exchanges, prices, wages, and textile
production in Europe “circa 800-1815 C.E.” The records, which have been
compiled from prior publications (<a

statistical compendium of grain sales in Cologne</a>), can be queried
online or <a

<p><strong>Abortion facility distances.</strong> <a

economist with a <a

policy</a>, has <a href="https://osf.io/8dg7r/">compiled a dataset</a>
that calculates — for every county in the contiguous US, every month
between January 2009 and June 2021 — the distance you would have to
travel to the nearest abortion facility. Researchers can also <a
href="https://osf.io/tj4ud/">request access to Myers’s underlying
database of the facilities themselves</a>. As described in her working
paper, “<a href="https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/14556">Measuring
the Burden: The Effect of Travel Distance on Abortions and Births</a>,”
Myers gathered the information from a range of sources, including state
licensing databases, facility websites, and Planned Parenthood
directories. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

continents (“Africa”). It’s officially available as <a
