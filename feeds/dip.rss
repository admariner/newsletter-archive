      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>K-12 learning arrangements, rushing waters, voluntary union recognition, four decades of Spanish elections, and cryptic crossword clues.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>K-12 learning arrangements.</strong> The <a href="https://www.covidschooldatahub.com">COVID-19 School Data Hub</a>, which <a href="https://emilyoster.substack.com/p/special-edition-today-covid-19-school">launched last week</a>, is “a central database for educators, researchers, and policymakers to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic shaped students’ modes of learning in 2020-21.” The project’s team, led by economist <a href="https://emilyoster.net/">Emily Oster</a>, has gathered data on learning models (in-person, virtual, or hybrid) used by public schools and districts at various points in time, their masking policies, and reported COVID-19 cases. The datasets can be <a href="https://www.covidschooldatahub.com/for_researchers">downloaded in bulk</a> or <a href="https://www.covidschooldatahub.com/explore_by_state">by state</a>. The coverage and granularity vary by topic and state; the project’s <a href="https://www.covidschooldatahub.com/methods">documentation</a> describes the collection methods and availability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rushing waters.</strong> The US Geological Survey’s <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis">National Water Information System</a> provides data on the “occurrence, quantity, quality, distribution, and movement of surface and underground waters” around the country. The <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/sw">surface water measurements</a> — mainly <a href="https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/tutorials/surface-water-data/how-do-i-interpret-gage-height-and-streamflow-values">streamflow and gage height</a> — come from tens of thousands of monitoring sites. (<a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/07378000/#parameterCode=00065&amp;startDT=2021-08-26&amp;endDT=2021-09-21">Here’s a site near Baton Rouge</a> before and after <a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_c06a0dba-159b-11ec-9f44-7769e5bab072.html">hurricanes Ida and Nicholas</a>.) There’s an <a href="https://waterservices.usgs.gov/">API for accessing the records</a>, including <a href="https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/DV-Service.html">daily summaries</a> and <a href="https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Service.html">real-time measurements</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/nwlon.html">NOAA’s water-level data</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-03-23-edition/">DIP 2016.03.23</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Voluntary union recognition.</strong> Civic technologist <a href="https://twitter.com/forestgregg">Forest Gregg</a> has begun <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/voluntary-recognitions-january-1-june-30-2021-116304/">filing FOIA requests</a> to the National Labor Relations Board <a href="https://github.com/labordata/nlrb-voluntary-recognitions">to collect newly-available data</a> on employers’ voluntary recognition of employee unions, drawn from agency’s <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-195/5581_7-20.pdf">relevant notification form</a>. The <a href="https://flatgithub.com/labordata/nlrb-voluntary-recognitions/blob/main/voluntary_recognitions.csv?sort=Date%20VR%20Request%20Received%2Cdesc">records so far</a> include 70+ recognitions in late 2020 and early 2021, plus nearly 1,000 from a prior reporting program between 2007 and 2009; they list the employer, union, case number, relevant dates, and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/reports/graphs-data/recent-election-results">Union election results</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-05-05-edition/">DIP 2021.05.05</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Four decades of Spanish elections.</strong> The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00975-y">Spanish Electoral Archive</a>, published this summer, provides detailed results of all municipal, regional, general, and European Parliament elections in Spain since the country’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_transition_to_democracy">transition to democracy</a> in the late 1970s. The <a href="http://sea.uv.es/gipeyop/sea.html">project</a>’s <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/SEA">datasets</a> standardize records from various official sources that, in many cases, drill down to the level of individual ballot boxes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hidden clue here will be!</strong> Data scientist <a href="https://www.eigenfoo.xyz/">George Ho</a> has compiled a <a href="https://cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz/">dataset of 589,000+ clues</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword">cryptic crosswords</a>, “collected from various blogs and publicly available digital archives.” The collection, <a href="https://github.com/eigenfoo/cryptics/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">released</a> earlier this month, is available to download and also <a href="https://cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz/clues/clues">explore online</a>. (<a href="https://cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz/clues/clues?_sort=rowid&amp;clue__contains=%21&amp;answer__exact=CRYPTIC">For example</a>.) Its “<a href="https://cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz/datasheet">datasheet</a>” describes the motivation, collection process, composition, and more.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Alternative fueling.</strong> The US Bureau of Transportation Statistics’ <a href="https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/national-transportation-atlas-database-summer-2021-adds-alternative-fuel-corridors-dataset">summer update</a> to its <a href="https://www.bts.gov/ntad">National Transportation Atlas Database</a> adds a <a href="https://data-usdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/alternative-fuel-corridors/explore">dataset</a> on “<a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/alternative_fuel_corridors/">alternative fuel corridors</a>” — stretches of highway with a sufficient frequency of fueling stations. (Electric vehicle corridors must, for instance, have charging stations at least every 50 miles.) The release covers electric, hydrogen, propane, compressed natural gas, and liquefied natural gas infrastructure, and complements a prior dataset of <a href="https://data-usdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/alternative-fueling-stations-1/explore">56,000+ such stations</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: The Department of Energy’s maps and datasets of <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/">alternative fueling stations</a> and <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/corridors">corridors</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>India’s political parties.</strong> The <a href="https://tcpd.ashoka.edu.in/">Trivedi Centre for Political Data</a> has published a <a href="https://tcpd.ashoka.edu.in/political-parties-of-india/">dataset</a> of “all parties that have contested national and state elections in India since 1962,” with an eye toward unifying the information across name changes. For each legislative level and state, the dataset <a href="https://github.com/tcpd/ppi/blob/main/17Aug2021TCPDPPI_1_0.pdf">indicates</a> each party’s first and last year contesting elections, number of seats won, number of female and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes">Scheduled Caste/Tribe</a> candidates fielded, and more.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Attacks against aid workers, fact-checks, offshore wind turbines, worker strikes in China, and creative Twitter bots.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Attacks against aid workers.</strong> The <a href="https://aidworkersecurity.org/">Aid Worker Security Database</a> is “a global compilation of reports on major security incidents involving deliberate acts of violence affecting aid workers,” with more than 3,200 records since 1997. Researchers gather, evaluate, and categorize information from official reports, partnerships with humanitarian agencies, news media, and other sources. For <a href="https://aidworkersecurity.org/incidents">each incident</a>, the database indicates its date and location; the number of workers killed, wounded, or kidnapped; their general affiliations; the type of attacker and means of attack; a brief description; and more. [h/t <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures">The Costs of War Project</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Fact-checks.</strong> <a href="https://www.claimreviewproject.com/">ClaimReview</a> is <a href="https://schema.org/ClaimReview">an open standard</a> for adding structured information to fact-check articles, such as the specific claim reviewed, where it appeared, the fact-checking organization, and the reviewer’s rating. The schema has been adopted by a range of big-name publishers, including the Washington Post, PolitiFact, and Univision, as well as smaller outlets around the world. The structured-data website <a href="https://datacommons.org/">Data Commons</a> hosts a <a href="https://www.datacommons.org/factcheck/download">feed of 29,000+ ClaimReview-tagged fact-checks</a>, as well as a curated subset.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Offshore wind turbines.</strong> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00982-z">Ting Zhang et al.</a> have trained an algorithm to identify wind turbines in coastal satellite imagery, and have used it to build a <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Global_offshore_wind_farm_dataset/13280252/5">dataset</a> listing the location and construction month of 6,924 turbines offshore of 14 countries between 2015 and 2019. To test the algorithm’s accuracy, the researchers compared its results to other sources, including the <a href="https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/">US Wind Turbine Database</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-04-25-edition/">DIP 2018.04.25</a>), the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/renewable-energy-planning-database-monthly-extract">UK’s Renewable Energy Planning Database</a>, the <a href="https://www.emodnet-humanactivities.eu/search-results.php?dataname=Wind+Farms+%28Polygons%29">European Marine Observation and Data Network</a>, and <a href="https://data.open-power-system-data.org/renewable_power_plants/2020-08-25">Open Power System Data</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-08-14-edition/">DIP 2019.08.14</a>).</p>

      <description>Legislator stock trades, national revenues, Africa building outlines, AI patents, and Formula One.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Legislator stock trades, national revenues, Africa building outlines, AI patents, and Formula One.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Legislator stock trades.</strong> US Congress members and candidates must report all stock purchases and sales exceeding $1,000, as well as those of their spouses and dependent children. Those records are technically available through the <a href="https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/PublicDisclosure/FinancialDisclosure">House</a>’s and <a href="https://efdsearch.senate.gov/">Senate</a>’s financial disclosure portals, but neither provides bulk data. Software engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/tcarambat">Tim Carabat</a>’s <a href="https://senatestockwatcher.com/">Senate Stock Watcher</a> and <a href="https://housestockwatcher.com/">House Stock Watcher</a> websites fill that gap by making the transactions available to browse, query, and download. In the case of the House, where reports are still provided as PDFs, Carabat also coordinates <a href="https://contributor.housestockwatcher.com/">the manual transcription of those files</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>National revenues.</strong> UNU-WIDER’s <a href="https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/government-revenue-dataset">Government Revenue Dataset</a> “aims to present a complete picture of government revenue and tax trends over time.” The project, <a href="https://www.wider.unu.edu/about-grd">updated this month</a>, currently covers 196 countries and goes back, in most cases, to the early 1980s. It <a href="https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/government-revenue-dataset-2021-source-selection">draws on data from OECD and IMF reports</a> and includes dozens of variables, such as total revenue, natural resource taxes, and foreign grants received. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/global-revenue-statistics-database.htm">The OECD’s Global Revenue Statistics Database</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-08-01-edition/">DIP 2018.08.01</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Africa building outlines.</strong> <a href="https://sites.research.google/open-buildings/">Open Buildings</a>, a project led by Google Research’s Ghana office, has <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/07/mapping-africas-buildings-with.html">published</a> a dataset of 516 million building footprints in Africa, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12283">estimated from satellite imagery</a>. The dataset, which you can explore online and download as CSVs, spans roughly 64% of the continent. It describes each estimated footprint’s coordinates, shape, and area, plus the detection algorithm’s degree of confidence. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints">Footprints of buildings in the US</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-07-18-edition/">DIP 2018.07.18</a>), and in <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/CanadianBuildingFootprints">Canada</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/on-location/an-open-building-outlines-dataset-for-new-zealand-eef8b558ef7a">New Zealand</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-09-25-edition/">DIP 2019.09.25</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>AI patents.</strong> The US Patent and Trademark Office has <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3866793">built a series of machine-learning models</a> to identify patents that involve AI technologies, such as natural language processing or computer vision. Its <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/economic-research/research-datasets/artificial-intelligence-patent-dataset">Artificial Intelligence Patent Dataset</a>, released in June, focuses on eight of these technologies and provides predictions of their presence (or absence) in 13.2 million granted patents and patent applications since 1976, finding hits in 11% of the documents.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Formula One.</strong> The <a href="https://ergast.com/mrd/">Ergast Developer API</a> provides seven decades of Formula One racing results, with details on each season, race, and result since 1950, each lap time since 1996, each pit stop since 2012, and more.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>COVID-era school enrollments.</strong> A collaboration led by Stanford University’s <a href="https://biglocalnews.org">Big Local News</a> has gathered (and standardized) recent enrollment figures from 33 state education departments. The resulting dataset, which spans ~70,000 public schools, can be <a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/zf406jp4427">downloaded in bulk</a> and <a href="https://stanford-school-enrollment-project.datasette.io/">explored online</a>. Most states provided data down to the grade level; some also provided student counts by gender, race, ethnicity, ELL status, homelessness, economic status, and/or disability. The timeframes vary, but include at least the 2019–20 and 2020–21 school years for each state. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WRm4KZPDGL1USPaf0E1AIa7gbyeKncv04Pg_rM1N7po/edit">documentation</a> for details. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/07/us/covid-kindergarten-enrollment.html">The Kindergarten Exodus</a>” (NYT), “<a href="https://edsource.org/2021/how-going-remote-led-to-dramatic-drops-in-public-school-students/659005">How going remote led to dramatic drops in public school students</a>” (EdSource), and a <a href="https://cepa.stanford.edu/content/revealed-preferences-school-reopening-evidence-public-school-disenrollment">new academic study</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Eviction laws.</strong> The <a href="https://www.lsc.gov/about-lsc/who-we-are">Legal Services Corporation</a>, a nonprofit that <a href="https://www.lsc.gov/initiatives/effect-state-local-laws-evictions">Congress has directed</a> to study local eviction procedures and their effects, has partnered with Temple University to compile a <a href="https://www.lsc.gov/initiatives/effect-state-local-laws-evictions/lsc-eviction-laws-database">database of eviction laws in all US states and territories</a>, and in a sample of 30 cities. It lists the causes for which landlords can evict tenants, the remedies available to unlawfully evicted tenants, filing fees, service requirements, and much more, with pointers to the relevant sections of each law. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://evictionlab.org/map/">Eviction rates</a> from <a href="https://evictionlab.org/about/">the Eviction Lab</a>.

<p><strong>Targeted mass killings.</strong> The <a href="https://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/research/projects/atrocity-forecasting">Atrocity Forecasting Project</a> has constructed (and <a href="https://twitter.com/goldsmithbe/status/1422776719631474690">recently updated</a>) a <a href="https://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/about-targeted-mass-killing-dataset">dataset of targeted mass killings</a>, which it defines as “the direct killing of noncombatant members of a group by an organized armed force or collective with the intent of destroying the group, or intimidating the group by creating a perception of imminent threat to its survival.” The dataset includes 207 such episodes from 1946 to 2020; it lists each atrocity’s timing and location, targeted groups, type of perpetrator, intent, severity, and other aspects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>European politics in the news.</strong> Projects at the <a href="https://poldem.eui.eu/">Observatory for Political Conflict and Democracy</a> analyze newspaper articles to construct <a href="https://poldem.eui.eu/download/">datasets</a> about election campaigns, protest events, and public debates <a href="https://poldem.eui.eu/data-overview/">across a range of European countries</a>. The projects’ <a href="https://poldem.eui.eu/codebooks/">codebooks</a> describe how they select the articles — often spanning multiple decades — and categorize the people, parties, actions, and issues in them.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Seattle street clocks.</strong> In 2004, Seattle historian <a href="http://ro-ket.com/">Rob Ketcherside</a> began a quest to find every public clock in the city, past and present. In 2015, he <a href="http://ba-kground.com/clock-db-where-seattles-street-clocks-were/">gathered his findings</a> into <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1455478">a dataset</a> that identifies each clock, owner, and piece of supporting evidence, which he <a href="https://twitter.com/ro_ket/status/1405187161339535374">continues to update</a>. Ketcherside has also compiled datasets of <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Drive-In_Public_Markets/3427760">drive-in public markets</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Seattle_Streets_Renamed_over_time/1387714">Seattle street renamings</a>, and <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/New_Structures_1890_Seattle/1341924">the city’s new buildings in 1890</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Three decades of Medicaid prescriptions.</strong> US law <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1927.htm">requires</a> state Medicaid agencies to report the quarterly number of outpatient prescriptions, total units, and reimbursement costs for each permutation of <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/medicaid-drug-rebate-program/index.html">each drug they’ve covered</a>. The federal Medicaid program’s <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/state-drug-utilization-data/index.html">State Drug Utilization Data</a> makes those records — <a href="https://data.medicaid.gov/State-Drug-Utilization/State-Drug-Utilization-Data-2020/va5y-jhsv">which spanned nearly 5 million rows in 2020 alone</a> — available as state-level and national files going back to 1991. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/national-drug-code-directory">The National Drug Code Directory</a>, which “contains product listing data submitted for all finished drugs including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, approved and unapproved drugs and repackaged and relabeled drugs.” [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/maguiremq/status/1395775742621847558">Michael Q. Maguire</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ranked-choice voting, continued.</strong> <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/about">FairVote</a>, an organization that advocates for <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Ranked-choice_voting_(RCV)">ranked-choice voting</a>, has gathered the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lU6viuXfay323Gl6zkH5itwmrUIUo9rAzalK_ntu-ZY/edit#gid=287253823">results of hundreds of elections</a> that <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/data_on_rcv#research_snapshot">used those rules</a>. The spreadsheets capture both single-winner and multi-winner elections in 26 jurisdictions between 2001 and 2021 — not yet including last week’s New York City primaries, whose results won’t be finalized <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/6/21/22544497/when-will-nyc-mayoral-primary-election-winner-be-announced">until all absentee ballots are processed</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://ranked.vote/">ranked.vote</a>, which provides detailed diagrams and <a href="https://github.com/ranked-vote/reports">data</a> on a smaller number of elections (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-05-27-edition/">DIP 2020.05.27</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Police activity in 2002 Gujarat news coverage.</strong> More than 1,000 people died in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_riots">inter-communal violence that erupted in Gujarat, India, in early 2002</a>. A team of political and computational scientists recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12936">trained students to annotate</a> 21,000+ sentences from 1,257 contemporaneous articles about the events published in the Times of India, asking them to categorize whether police officers used force, killed someone, made arrests, failed to intervene, and/or took any other action. The <a href="https://github.com/slanglab/IndiaPoliceEvents">resulting dataset</a> includes the raw annotations as well as final sentence- and document-level classifications.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Android permissions.</strong> Developer <a href="https://gauthamp10.github.io/">Gautham Prakash</a> has built a dataset of the <a href="https://github.com/gauthamp10/android-permissions-dataset">device permissions requested by more than 1 million Android apps</a> in the Google Play marketplace. The permissions include the ability to make calls, read the phone’s contacts, record audio, get the phone’s precise location, know what other apps are running, and dozens more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The cat’s meow.</strong> For a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/9/8/543/htm">2019 study</a>, University of Milan researchers collected and analyzed <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4008297">440 recordings</a> of “meows emitted by cats in different contexts”: when brushed by their owners, when isolated in an unfamiliar environment, and when waiting for food.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>2020 election emails, civilian harm in Yemen, medical abbreviations, NYC constituent inquiries, and Forrest Gump-ology.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2020 election emails.</strong> To build the <a href="https://electionemails2020.org/">Princeton Corpus of Political Emails</a>, researchers auto-subscribed to thousands of mailing lists run by candidates, political parties, and other groups participating in the 2020 US election cycle. They’ve received 400,000+ messages so far. Since October, you’ve been able to search the corpus online; as of last month, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcgjZo-D1nNON4d90H2j0VLtTdxiHK6Y8HPJSpdRu4w5YILw/viewform">request access</a> to v1.0 of its bulk dataset, which contains 300,000+ emails received through Election Day. For each, it provides the subject and body text, sender, office sought, and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.lindseycormack.com/dcinbox-data-downloads">Congressional e-newsletters</a> via <a href="https://www.dcinbox.com/">DCinbox</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-03-03-edition/">DIP 2021.03.03</a>), and political emails gathered <a href="https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-wheres-my-email">by The Markup</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/candidate-emails">by FiveThirtyEight</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-03-04-edition/">DIP 2020.03.04</a>). [h/t <a href="http://samanthaguss.com">Samantha Guss</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Civilian harm in Yemen.</strong> The UN-affiliated <a href="https://civilianimpactmonitoring.org/">Civilian Impact Monitoring Project</a> <a href="https://civilianimpactmonitoring.org/methodology">conducts</a> “real-time collection, analysis and dissemination of open source data on the civilian impact from armed violence in Yemen.” Its public datasets include the <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/yemen-civilian-impact-incidents-and-civilian-casualties">monthly incident and casualty counts</a> and the <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/yemen-impact-on-civilian-infrastructure">incidents per region damaging various types of civilian infrastructure</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.acaps.org/">ACAPS</a>, a humanitarian analysis group, <a href="https://data.humdata.org/search?q=%22Yemen%20CrisisInSight%22&amp;sort=title_case_insensitive%20desc">is aggregating data</a> on a range of “key drivers” and outcomes of the crisis (such as fuel prices, malnutrition, and internal displacement) in each district and governorate. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://yemendataproject.org/">The Yemen Data Project</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-04-03-edition/">DIP 2019.04.03</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Medical abbreviations.</strong> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00929-4">Lisa Grossman Liu et al.</a> have developed the <a href="https://github.com/lisavirginia/clinical-abbreviations/tree/master/metainventory">Medical Abbreviation and Acronym Meta-Inventory</a>, a database that maps 104,000+ medical abbreviations and acronyms to 170,000+ different meanings. To build it, the authors standardized data from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00929-4/tables/2">eight sources</a>, including the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html">Unified Medical Language System</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medical_abbreviations">Wikipedia</a>, and <a href="http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/arrowsmith_uic/adam.html">ADAM: Another Database of Abbreviations in MEDLINE</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046418302132">At our urban academic medical center, acronyms constituted 30–50% of the words in a typical medicine admission note.</a>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NYC constituent inquiries.</strong> Many members of the New York City Council use <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/districts/data1/">CouncilStat</a> to track their constituents’ requests, complaints, and other inquiries. The tool’s <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Council-Constituent-Services/9hzi-kbqb">public dataset</a> contains 260,000+ anonymized entries going back to 2015. It identifies each inquiry’s topic (e.g., tax preparation, citizenship, affordable housing, street resurfacing), district, and dates opened and closed. <strong>As seen in</strong>: <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/6/15/22536020/nyc-city-council-constituent-service">A pre-election analysis of the requests</a> by <em>The City</em>’s <a href="https://www.twitter.com/annjychoi">Ann Choi</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Forrest Gump-ology.</strong> <a href="https://www.studyforrest.org/">StudyForrest</a> is “a one-of-a-kind resource for studying high-level cognition in the human brain under complex, natural stimulation.” Specifically: while watching <em>Forrest Gump</em>. In addition to fMRI scans and eye-tracking measurements, <a href="https://www.studyforrest.org/data.html">the project’s datasets</a> include extensive annotations of the film itself, such as the <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2273/v1">location and timing of each shot</a>.</p>
