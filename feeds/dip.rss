on Strategic Risks</a>’s <a
href="https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/nolan/nuclear-systems-project/">Nuclear
Weapon Systems Project</a> aims “to document every type of nuclear
weapon system ever deployed” by China, France, Russia, the UK, and the
US — the five “nuclear weapon states” per the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons">Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty</a>. The project’s <a

dataset</a>, <a
href="https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/2023/11/29/introducing-the-nuclear-weapon-systems-project/">launched
last week</a>, currently covers 250+ such systems. For each, it provides
the system’s name, country, type (gravity bomb, torpedo, ICBM, etc.),
military branches in charge of deployment, “mission” (tactical,
strategic, or hybrid), years introduced and retired, replacement system,
and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a

judges (270+), and more from the court’s inception in 1952 through 2022.
That first table, for instance, lists each case’s name, ID, sub-court,
year, judgment status, appeal status, and additional details. [h/t <a

<p><strong>The Fed’s “dot plots.”</strong> <a

Projections” reports. Those reports contain a chart that’s come to be
known as the Fed’s “<a

plot</a>,” which tallies the committee members’ forecasts of the
year-end <a

people (i.e., all but three of the co-authors) tossed coins of 46
different currencies × denominations and obtained a total number of

Event Data Project</a> “collects real-time data on the locations, dates,
actors, fatalities, and types of all reported political violence and
protest events around the world.” <a

collaboration of Federal Reserve Banks, “aims to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the payment behavior of US consumers.” The survey
component inquires about demographics, habits, and preferences,
including respondents’ use of different payment methods (cash, check,
credit card, debit card, mobile payments, et cetera). The diary
component asks participants to record their account balances and every

lists the text, type, jurisdiction, source, citation, and URL of
220,000+ documents. It includes “every in force statute and regulation
in the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia,
South Australia, Tasmania and Norfolk Island, in addition to thousands
of bills and hundreds of thousands of court and tribunal decisions.”

Computational Policy Lab and Big Local News</a> “set out in 2018 on a

question of all: <a
href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0290397">how
many people are being jailed for unpaid court debts</a>?” To do so, <a

jails”; last month, their <a

anonymized versions of data</a> received from 100 counties (primarily in
Texas and Wisconsin), “totalling more than 4 million individual jail
booking records,” plus warrant data from Oklahoma and Delaware. The
datasets indicate (where available) each arrestee’s race, ethnicity,
sex, age, state, ZIP code, booking date, release date, and release type,
as well as each charge’s description, severity, and whether it

aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an aircraft, vehicle, or
person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and
take-off of aircraft.” It currently contains 30,000+ entries, spanning
October 2001 through July 2023; each <a

<p><strong>Education reform.</strong> The <a
href="https://werd.stanford.edu/">World Education Reform Database</a>
describes 10,000+ education policy changes reported by 180+ countries to
international organizations, among other sources. The project, <a
href="https://werd.stanford.edu/our-team">led by</a> education policy
scholars <a href="http://www.patriciabromley.com/">Patricia Bromley</a>
and <a href="https://www.riekijima.com/">Rie Kijima</a>, <a
href="https://werd.stanford.edu/database">focuses on</a>
“<em>systemic</em> reforms that envision a supra-school administrative
level and aim to impact the wider education system, rather than small
projects that target individual schools.” The <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/C0TWXM">database</a>
lists each reform’s country, year, name, and summary. Although some of
the reforms in the database were introduced hundreds of years ago, the
vast majority occurred in the last 50 years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Kia/Hyundai thefts.</strong> “Cities around the U.S. are
facing a staggering new normal when it comes to stolen cars,” <a
href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkaq9z/us-cities-have-a-staggering-problem-of-kia-and-hyundai-thefts-this-data-shows-it">writes</a>

in thefts of Kia and Hyundai vehicles</a>, millions of which lack
“engine immobilizers, a basic anti-theft device that is legally mandated
in Canada and Europe.” Gordon has requested car theft data from more
than 100 cities, and received it from 43 so far. He’s updating a <a

<p><strong>Michigan air permit violations.</strong> For local news
organization <a href="https://planetdetroit.org/">Planet Detroit</a>,
freelance journalist <a href="https://shelbyjouppi.com/">Shelby

of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy</a>. The <a
href="https://github.com/Planet-Detroit/air-permit-violation-dashboard/">dataset</a>
lists 1,500+ violation notices since 2018; for each, it provides the
notice date and findings, facility name and location, and more. To
construct it, Jouppi had to <a
href="https://shelbyjouppi.com/egle-air-database/">scrape individual
notice PDFs from the department’s website</a> and then extract the
information from those documents. <strong>Read more</strong>: “<a

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Linked historical censuses, fracking fluids, Europopulism, GitHub
metrics, and ancient places.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Censuses, linked.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.censustree.org/">Census Tree</a>, developed by <a
href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31671">Kasey Buckles et al.</a>, “is
the largest-ever database of record links among the historical U.S.
censuses, with over 700 million links for people living in the United
States between 1850 and 1940.” By the <a
href="https://www.censustree.org/our-team">team</a>’s <a
href="https://sites.google.com/nd.edu/censustreefaq">estimates</a>, the
dataset “includes over 70% of the possible links that <em>could</em> be
made for men, and over 60% of possible links for women.” To build it,
the researchers <a
href="https://www.censustree.org/methodology">began</a> with genealogy
records from <a
href="https://www.familysearch.org/">FamilySearch.org</a>, developed a
machine learning algorithm to identify additional links, and
incorporated data from other census-linking projects. Each Census Tree
row connects an individual’s <a
href="https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/HISTID">IPUMS
identifier</a> in one decade’s census to their identifier in another.
Per the project’s <a
href="https://www.censustree.org/quickstart">instructions</a>, you’ll
need to download the Census data itself <a
href="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/full_count.shtml">from IPUMS</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Fracking fluids.</strong> Since <a
href="https://www.fracfocus.org/learn/about-fracfocus">launching in
2011</a>, <a href="https://fracfocus.org/">FracFocus</a> has become the
largest registry of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking">hydraulic fracturing</a>
chemical disclosures in the US. The database, available to explore
online and <a href="https://fracfocus.org/data-download">download in
bulk</a>, contains 210,000+ such disclosures from fracking operators; it
details the location, timing, and water volume of each fracking job,
plus the names and amounts of chemicals used. The project is <a
href="https://fracfocus.org/about-us">managed</a> by the <a
href="https://www.gwpc.org/overview/">Ground Water Protection
Council</a>, “a nonprofit 501(c)6 organization whose members consist of
state ground water regulatory agencies”. <strong>As seen in</strong>:

series</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Europopulism.</strong> <a href="https://popu-list.org/">The
PopuList</a>, constructed by <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/populist-a-database-of-populist-farleft-and-farright-parties-using-expertinformed-qualitative-comparative-classification-eiqcc/EBF60489A0E1E3D91A6FE066C7ABA2CA">Matthijs
Rooduijn et al.</a>, “offers academics and journalists an overview of
populist, far-left and far-right parties in Europe from 1989 until
2022.” <a href="https://osf.io/2ewkq/">Version 3.0 of the dataset</a>,
released last month, lists each party’s country, local/English names,
presence in parliament, and identifiers in the <a
href="https://partyfacts.herokuapp.com/">Party Facts</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-01-16-edition/">DIP

href="https://popu-list.org/about/">comparativists and country
experts</a> classified the party (outright or “borderline”) as populist,
far-right, far-left, and/or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism">euroskeptic</a>, and
for which time periods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>GitHub metrics.</strong> GitHub’s new <a
href="https://innovationgraph.github.com/">Innovation Graph</a> datasets
present a range of quarterly metrics on the code-sharing site,
aggregated by “economy” — a concept similar to “country” but slightly
broader. (Antarctica is an “economy” in the data, for example.) The <a
href="https://github.com/github/innovationgraph">datasets</a> count the
number of developers based in each economy, their repositories and <a
href="https://github.com/git-guides/git-push">code pushes</a>, most-used
programming languages, and more. As noted in the project’s <a
href="https://github.com/github/innovationgraph/blob/main/docs/datasheet.md">datasheet</a>,
the locations are based on IP addresses, so <a

<p><strong>US facility GHG emissions.</strong> The EPA’s <a
href="https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do#/facility/">Facility Level
Information on Greenhouse Gases Tool</a> “gives you access to greenhouse
gas data reported to EPA by large emitters, facilities that inject
CO<sub>2</sub> underground, and suppliers of products that result in GHG
emissions when used in the United States.” The information comes from
the agency’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting">Greenhouse Gas
Reporting Program</a>, which also provides <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets">bulk data
downloads</a>. Per the EPA: “Approximately 8,000 facilities are required
to report their emissions annually, and the reported data are made
available to the public in October of each year.” The data, which go
back to 2010, indicate the <a

<p><strong>Net migration estimates.</strong> Using national and
subnational data on birth rates, death rates, and population counts, <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01689-4">Venla Niva et
al.</a> have constructed a <a
href="https://zenodo.org/record/7997134">dataset of estimated net
migration</a> for each part of the world, each year between 2000 and
2019. The estimates are available as gridded data (with ~10km
resolution) and at three levels of administrative units: national,
provincial, and communal. (For the US, the latter two levels correspond
to states and counties, respectively.) The researchers have also
published an <a

<p><strong>Political contributions, enhanced.</strong> Political
scientist <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~bonica/">Adam Bonica</a>’s
<a href="https://data.stanford.edu/dime">Database on Ideology, Money in
Politics, and Elections</a> (DIME) gathers “500 million itemized
political contributions made by individuals and organizations to local,
state, and federal elections covering from 1979 to 2020.” The project,
which received a <a
href="https://listserv.wustl.edu/scripts/wa.exe?A2=1702A&amp;L=POLMETH&amp;D=0&amp;H=N&amp;P=6749708">major
update last month</a>, “is intended to make data on campaign finance and
elections (1) more centralized and accessible, (2) easier to work with,
and (3) more versatile […].” It assigns each contributor a unique
identifier, geocodes their stated addresses, quantifies their
ideological orientation, and more. The raw data come from several
sources, including the <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/">Federal
Election Commission</a> and <a
href="https://www.opensecrets.org/">OpenSecrets</a>.

<p><strong>Historical newspaper articles.</strong> <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12477">Melissa Dell et al.</a>’s <a
href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/dell-research-harvard/AmericanStories">American
Stories dataset</a> contains the text of ~400 million newspaper
articles, extracted from ~20 million public-domain scans in the Library
of Congress’s <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/">Chronicling
America</a> project (<a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-08-16-edition/">DIP
2017.08.16</a>). To construct the dataset, the authors <a
href="https://github.com/dell-research-harvard/AmericanStories">built</a>
“a novel deep learning pipeline that incorporates layout detection,
legibility classification, custom OCR, and the association of article
texts spanning multiple bounding boxes.” For each article, the dataset
provides the newspaper name, edition number, date of publication
(largely in the 1800s–1920s), page number, headline, byline, and article
text. <strong>Previously</strong>: The LOC’s <a

<p><strong>Prigozhin audio messages.</strong> <a
href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/">Giorgio Comai</a> has <a
href="https://tadadit.xyz/posts/2023-08-telegram_prigozhin/">collected
and auto-transcribed</a> hundreds of audio messages from Russian
mercenary leader <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Prigozhin">Yevgeny
Prigozhin</a>, which were posted “on his official Telegram channel - the
press service of his holding company” from late 2022 through June 2023.
For each transcribed segment within each message, the <a
href="https://tadadit.xyz/datasets/prigozhin_audio_files/">resulting
datasets</a> (one in Russian and one auto-translated into English)
include the message ID, time posted, segment timestamp, and segment
text. [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/_federicocaruso">Federico

<p><strong>The “Unknome.”</strong> The human genome has been sequenced,
but what do all those genes do? <a
href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002222">João
J. Rocha et al.</a>’s <a
href="https://unknome.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/">Unknome database</a> assigns a
“knownness” score to “all protein clusters that contain at least 1
protein from humans or any of 11 model organisms.” The score is based on
the density of annotations in the <a
href="https://geneontology.org/">Gene Ontology knowledgebase</a>, which
bills itself as “the world’s largest source of information on the
functions of genes.” The clustering comes from another downloadable
database, <a href="https://pantherdb.org/">PANTHER</a>, which contains
“comprehensive information about the evolution of protein-coding gene
families.”</p>

<p><strong>License plate designs.</strong> <a
href="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/">Beautiful Public Data</a>’s
<a href="https://jonkeegan.com/">Jon Keegan</a> scraped the websites of
every US state’s (and DC’s) motor vehicle agency to assemble a <a
