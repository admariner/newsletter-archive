      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>COVID-era school enrollments, eviction laws, targeted mass killings, European politics in the news, and Seattle street clocks.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COVID-era school enrollments.</strong> A collaboration led by Stanford University’s <a href="https://biglocalnews.org">Big Local News</a> has gathered (and standardized) recent enrollment figures from 33 state education departments. The resulting dataset, which spans ~70,000 public schools, can be <a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/zf406jp4427">downloaded in bulk</a> and <a href="https://stanford-school-enrollment-project.datasette.io/">explored online</a>. Most states provided data down to the grade level; some also provided student counts by gender, race, ethnicity, ELL status, homelessness, economic status, and/or disability. The timeframes vary, but include at least the 2019–20 and 2020–21 school years for each state. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WRm4KZPDGL1USPaf0E1AIa7gbyeKncv04Pg_rM1N7po/edit">documentation</a> for details. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/07/us/covid-kindergarten-enrollment.html">The Kindergarten Exodus</a>” (NYT), “<a href="https://edsource.org/2021/how-going-remote-led-to-dramatic-drops-in-public-school-students/659005">How going remote led to dramatic drops in public school students</a>” (EdSource), and a <a href="https://cepa.stanford.edu/content/revealed-preferences-school-reopening-evidence-public-school-disenrollment">new academic study</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Eviction laws.</strong> The <a href="https://www.lsc.gov/about-lsc/who-we-are">Legal Services Corporation</a>, a nonprofit that <a href="https://www.lsc.gov/initiatives/effect-state-local-laws-evictions">Congress has directed</a> to study local eviction procedures and their effects, has partnered with Temple University to compile a <a href="https://www.lsc.gov/initiatives/effect-state-local-laws-evictions/lsc-eviction-laws-database">database of eviction laws in all US states and territories</a>, and in a sample of 30 cities. It lists the causes for which landlords can evict tenants, the remedies available to unlawfully evicted tenants, filing fees, service requirements, and much more, with pointers to the relevant sections of each law. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://evictionlab.org/map/">Eviction rates</a> from <a href="https://evictionlab.org/about/">the Eviction Lab</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Targeted mass killings.</strong> The <a href="https://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/research/projects/atrocity-forecasting">Atrocity Forecasting Project</a> has constructed (and <a href="https://twitter.com/goldsmithbe/status/1422776719631474690">recently updated</a>) a <a href="https://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/about-targeted-mass-killing-dataset">dataset of targeted mass killings</a>, which it defines as “the direct killing of noncombatant members of a group by an organized armed force or collective with the intent of destroying the group, or intimidating the group by creating a perception of imminent threat to its survival.” The dataset includes 207 such episodes from 1946 to 2020; it lists each atrocity’s timing and location, targeted groups, type of perpetrator, intent, severity, and other aspects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>European politics in the news.</strong> Projects at the <a href="https://poldem.eui.eu/">Observatory for Political Conflict and Democracy</a> analyze newspaper articles to construct <a href="https://poldem.eui.eu/download/">datasets</a> about election campaigns, protest events, and public debates <a href="https://poldem.eui.eu/data-overview/">across a range of European countries</a>. The projects’ <a href="https://poldem.eui.eu/codebooks/">codebooks</a> describe how they select the articles — often spanning multiple decades — and categorize the people, parties, actions, and issues in them. [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/njdullaghan">Neil Dullaghan</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Seattle street clocks.</strong> In 2004, Seattle historian <a href="http://ro-ket.com/">Rob Ketcherside</a> began a quest to find every public clock in the city, past and present. In 2015, he <a href="http://ba-kground.com/clock-db-where-seattles-street-clocks-were/">gathered his findings</a> into <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1455478">a dataset</a> that identifies each clock, owner, and piece of supporting evidence, which he <a href="https://twitter.com/ro_ket/status/1405187161339535374">continues to update</a>. Ketcherside has also compiled datasets of <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Drive-In_Public_Markets/3427760">drive-in public markets</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Seattle_Streets_Renamed_over_time/1387714">Seattle street renamings</a>, and <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/New_Structures_1890_Seattle/1341924">the city’s new buildings in 1890</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Refugees resettled in the US.</strong> <a href="https://www.refugeeresettlementdata.com/">Axel Dreher et al.</a> have published <a href="https://www.refugeeresettlementdata.com/data.html">person-level data on 2.5+ million refugees</a> who arrived in the US between 1975 and 2008. The anonymized records, obtained from the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/">National Archives</a> and originally collected by the <a href="https://acf.hhs.gov/orr">Office of Refugee Resettlement</a>, indicate each refugee’s country and date of birth, marital and family status, education level and English proficiency, date of US arrival, US city of resettlement, and more. The researchers also combined these records with public reports from the <a href="https://www.wrapsnet.org/">Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2015-11-25-edition/">DIP 2015.11.25</a>) to create a geocoded dataset of annual resettlements by citizenship and destination city from 1975 to 2018.

<p><strong>Water politics.</strong> Oregon State University’s <a href="https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/content/international-water-event-database">International Water Events Database</a> summarizes 7,000+ episodes from 1948 to 2008 that “concern water as a scarce or consumable resource or as a quantity to be managed,” categorizing their intensities and indicating the basins and countries involved. The <a href="https://pacinst.org/">Pacific Institute</a>’s <a href="https://www.worldwater.org/water-conflict/">Water Conflict Chronology</a> documents 926 events (including a few legends) between 3000 BC and 2019 that involved violence or the threat of it. Bernhauer et al.’s <a href="https://www.prio.org/Publications/Publication/?x=5118">Water-Related Intrastate Conflict and Cooperation</a> dataset details 10,000+ events in the Middle East, Mediterranean, and Sahel between 1997 and 2009. <strong>Related</strong>: Takeshi Wada’s “<a href="https://ifi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sdgs_wp_2020_wada_en.pdf">Geographic Distribution of Water Conflicts Worldwide: A Comparative Analysis of Four Databases</a>” (<em>pdf</em>) discusses these resources plus <a href="https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html">GDELT</a>, a broader-scope event database.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Government regulations.</strong> <a href="https://www.quantgov.org/about">QuantGov</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/quantgov">open-source</a> project of the free-market-oriented <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/">Mercatus Center</a>, “solves the problem of quantifying large amounts of policy text for research and comprehension by using machine learning and natural language processing.” Its <a href="https://www.quantgov.org/history">RegData</a> initiative applies this approach to government regulations over time — quantifying their length and linguistic complexity and trying to identify their relevant <a href="https://www.census.gov/naics/">NAICS</a>-classified industries. Its <a href="https://www.quantgov.org/download-data">datasets</a> examine rules enacted by the federal government and most US states, as well as federal and subnational regulations from Australia, Canada, and India.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Three decades of Medicaid prescriptions.</strong> US law <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1927.htm">requires</a> state Medicaid agencies to report the quarterly number of outpatient prescriptions, total units, and reimbursement costs for each permutation of <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/medicaid-drug-rebate-program/index.html">each drug they’ve covered</a>. The federal Medicaid program’s <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/state-drug-utilization-data/index.html">State Drug Utilization Data</a> makes those records — <a href="https://data.medicaid.gov/State-Drug-Utilization/State-Drug-Utilization-Data-2020/va5y-jhsv">which spanned nearly 5 million rows in 2020 alone</a> — available as state-level and national files going back to 1991. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/national-drug-code-directory">The National Drug Code Directory</a>, which “contains product listing data submitted for all finished drugs including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, approved and unapproved drugs and repackaged and relabeled drugs.” [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/maguiremq/status/1395775742621847558">Michael Q.

The spreadsheets capture both single-winner and multi-winner elections in 26 jurisdictions between 2001 and 2021 — not yet including last week’s New York City primaries, whose results won’t be finalized <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/6/21/22544497/when-will-nyc-mayoral-primary-election-winner-be-announced">until all absentee ballots are processed</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://ranked.vote/">ranked.vote</a>, which provides detailed diagrams and <a href="https://github.com/ranked-vote/reports">data</a> on a smaller number of elections (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-05-27-edition/">DIP 2020.05.27</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Police activity in 2002 Gujarat news coverage.</strong> More than 1,000 people died in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_riots">inter-communal violence that erupted in Gujarat, India, in early 2002</a>. A team of political and computational scientists recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12936">trained students to annotate</a> 21,000+ sentences from 1,257 contemporaneous articles about the events published in the Times of India, asking them to categorize whether police officers used force, killed someone, made arrests, failed to intervene, and/or took any other action. The <a href="https://github.com/slanglab/IndiaPoliceEvents">resulting dataset</a> includes the raw annotations as well as final sentence- and document-level classifications.

<p><strong>The cat’s meow.</strong> For a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/9/8/543/htm">2019 study</a>, University of Milan researchers collected and analyzed <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4008297">440 recordings</a> of “meows emitted by cats in different contexts”: when brushed by their owners, when isolated in an unfamiliar environment, and when waiting for food.

<p><strong>Drought in the United States.</strong> “Maybe you’ve seen it in the media: that map of the U.S. painted with blobs of yellow, orange and red. It shows drought – but how do we know which colors go where?” <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/">US Drought Monitor</a>, a collaboration between the University of Nebraska and two federal agencies, <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/About/WhatistheUSDM.aspx">describes the process behind its weekly maps</a>. Its <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/About/ContactUs.aspx">authors</a>, who take turns drawing the drought-intensity boundaries, synthesize various sources of quantitative information — such as the <a href="https://wrcc.dri.edu/wwdt/">Palmer Drought Severity Index</a> and the <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/id/snow/?cid=stelprdb1240689">Surface Water Supply Index</a> — and local knowledge. The results can be <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Data.aspx">downloaded</a> as geospatial files, timeseries, and summary statistics. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/11/climate/california-western-drought-map.html">How Severe Is the Western Drought? See For Yourself</a>,” from the New York Times.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>US vaccinations over time.</strong> The CDC has begun publishing <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh">daily-historical data on vaccination progress in the US</a>, going back to mid-December 2020. For the country overall, each state and territory, and a handful of other jurisdictions (e.g., the Bureau of Prisons), the dataset indicates the number of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and J&amp;J/Janssen doses delivered, total doses administered by age group, percentages of populations fully vaccinated, and more. Less-detailed information is also available for <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh">each county over time</a> and for <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccination-Demographics-in-the-United-St/km4m-vcsb">national demographic trends</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: My colleague <a href="https://www.peteraldhous.com/">Peter Aldhous</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/paldhous/status/1401948291093340160">incorporated</a> the CDC’s data into <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/covid-vaccine-tracker">BuzzFeed News’ vaccination tracker</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Weekly gas prices.</strong> Every Monday, the Energy Information Administration <a href="https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gas_proc-methods.php">collects data</a> “on retail prices for regular, midgrade, and premium grades of gasoline from a sample of retail gasoline outlets across the United States using Form EIA-878, <em>Motor Gasoline Price Survey Schedule A</em>.” The survey informs the agency’s <a href="https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/">average gas price estimates</a>, which are available at a national and regional level, as well as for a few selected states and cities, going back to the 1990s (though the sampling methodology changed in 2018). The EIA also <a href="https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/diesel_proc-methods.php">collects data</a> on diesel prices, using a separate survey.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lynching victims, gun-dealer violations, more police misconduct complaints, UK lobbying, and fermentative microbes.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lynching victims.</strong> In the 1880s–1910s, the Chicago Tribune, Tuskegee University, and the NAACP each began collecting data on lynchings in the US. In the 1990s, sociologists <a href="https://soc.washington.edu/people/stewart-tolnay">Stewart Tolnay</a> and <a href="https://sociology.uga.edu/directory/people/e-m-beck">E.M. Beck</a> reverified, standardized, and extended those three collections, compiling a now-seminal dataset that described 2,800+ victims of these mob-led extrajudicial killings — the majority of whom were Black — in 10 Southern states from 1882–1930. The researchers shared a copy of that data with <a href="http://people.uncw.edu/hinese/HAL/HAL%20Web%20Page.htm">Project HAL</a>, where you can download it. Meanwhile, they and collaborators have continued <a href="http://lynching.csde.washington.edu/#/about">updating and expanding the research</a>; you can <a href="http://lynching.csde.washington.edu/#/contact">request access to their latest datasets</a>. In 2019, sociologists <a href="http://www.charlieseguin.com/">Charles Seguin</a> and <a href="https://rigby.netlify.app/">David Rigby</a> published <a href="https://osf.io/kr8yc/">a dataset</a> that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023119841780">aims to complement Tolnay and Beck’s</a> by presenting information (<a href="http://davidrigbysociology.com/lynching_dot_map">and an interactive map</a>) on 1,328 lynching victims in 38 additional states from 1883–1941.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Gun-dealer violations.</strong> “The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives inspects thousands of licensed gun dealers and manufacturers each year, but what happens in those investigations is rarely revealed to the public.” So reporters at The Trace and USA Today <a href="https://projects.thetrace.org/inspections/methodology/">compiled</a> a <a href="https://projects.thetrace.org/inspections/">database</a> of nearly 2,000 ATF inspections between July 2015 and June 2017 with violations, based on PDFs obtained <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6170066/brady-center-to-prevent-gun-violence-v-us-department-of-justice/">through a FOIA lawsuit</a> by the <a href="https://www.bradyunited.org/">Brady gun control group</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>More police misconduct complaints.</strong> The <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> has updated its <a href="https://github.com/new-york-civil-liberties-union/NYPD-Misconduct-Complaint-Database-Updated">NYPD misconduct complaint database</a> to include “the race or ethnicity of the impacted person and officer, incident location, current employment status of the officer, and other data,” and to remove duplicates in the original records obtained from the city. <strong>Also</strong>: Philadelphia publishes <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/police-complaints">monthly-updated data</a> on police complaints from the past five years. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-ccrb/">ProPublica’s subset of the NYPD data</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-07-29-edition/">DIP 2020.07.29</a>); and <a href="https://cpdp.co/">CPDP’s database of complaints against Chicago officers</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2015-11-25-edition/">DIP 2015.11.25</a>). <strong>Read more</strong>: The Financial Times has <a href="https://github.com/Financial-Times/police-misconduct-complaints-analysis">compared and analyzed</a> these cities’ datasets, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/141182fc-7727-4af8-a555-5418fa46d09e">finding</a> that the 10% most-cited officers account for roughly a third of all complaints.

<p><strong>Lobbying in Britain.</strong> <a href="https://openaccess.transparency.org.uk/">Open Access UK</a> is a database of 70,000+ meetings between lobbyists and government ministers going back to 2012. The records have been <a href="https://openaccess.transparency.org.uk/about.php">compiled by Transparency International UK</a> from scattered official publications; they list the date of the meeting, the lobbying organization, the minister lobbied, and a brief description of the meeting’s purpose.

<p><strong>Rainfall records, rescued.</strong> For centuries, a network of volunteers recorded monthly measurements from thousands of rain gauges across the UK and Ireland. Those observations were trapped on paper forms known “10-year sheets” until very recently, when the UK’s Meteorological Office <a href="https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_d383374a-91c3-4a7b-ba96-41b81cfb9d67">scanned them</a>. But the records still weren’t in an analyzable form, so <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue/about/team">a team of climate scientists</a> organized <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue">the Rainfall Rescue project</a>, sending <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52040822">a call for help</a> just as Britain entered its first COVID-19 lockdown. Within months, more than 16,000 volunteers had transcribed all 65,000+ pages of scans, entering <a href="https://github.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue">millions of rain measurements from 1677–1960</a>. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins/status/1392758650201120771">A Twitter thread from organizer Ed Hawkins</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Hate groups, law schools, TSA screenings, European cross-border rail, and e.e. cummings.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hate groups.</strong> For decades, the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> has conducted annual censuses of US-based hate groups, <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/20200318/frequently-asked-questions-about-hate-groups">which it defines</a> as those with “beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.” <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2021/02/01/year-hate-and-extremism-2020-hate-groups-became-more-difficult-track-amid-covid-and">Its 2020 review</a> found 838 such groups — a decline from prior years, which the researchers attribute to several factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of difficult-to-track online networks, and “the continuing collapse of the Ku Klux Klan.” The center’s <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map">map of 2000–2020 findings</a> links to annual spreadsheets that detail each group’s title, location, and ideology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Law schools.</strong> <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/accreditation/">To receive accreditation</a> from the American Bar Association, law schools must submit a range of data-points about tuition, financial aid, student demographics, class sizes, employment outcomes, and more. The ABA’s <a href="http://www.abarequireddisclosures.org/Disclosure509.aspx">disclosure site</a> provides school-level PDF reports, as well as annual spreadsheets comparing all accredited schools since 2011. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/there-are-only-two-black-male-prosecutors-all-long-island">There Are Only Two Black Male Prosecutors For All Of Long Island</a>,” a recent Gothamist article that uses the data.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>TSA screenings.</strong> In <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/foia/readingroom">its FOIA reading room</a>, the US Transportation Security Administration publishes weekly PDF files that indicate the number of people passing through its checkpoints, broken down by hour and location. IT specialist <a href="https://github.com/mikelor">Mike Lorengo</a> has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/mx87q8/tsa_throughput_dataset_alternate_source/">converting</a> these PDFs <a href="https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput">into structured data files</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: The TSA also publishes a <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput">table of total “traveler throughput”</a> for each day in 2021, compared to the same weekdays in 2020 and 2019.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>European cross-border rail.</strong> Drawing from company websites and communications with government railway agencies, <a href="https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/About-us">OBC Transeuropa</a>’s <a href="https://twitter.com/GianlucaDeFeo">Gianluca De Feo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lorferr">Lorenzo Ferrari</a> have <a href="https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/More-and-more-trains-crossing-European-borders">identified 271 passenger train routes</a> that cross Europe’s national borders. For each route, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12deGLMuX3u-mUaHGlLT0-TXIGZnQ-NILCt6NRA4s0pU/edit">their dataset</a> lists its two endpoints, the countries it passes through, route type (high-speed, regional, etc.), operating company, and more. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Europe/Four-ways-of-looking-at-European-cross-border-rail-links-209800">Four ways of looking at European cross-border rail links</a>,” a follow-up article.

<p><strong>Edward Estlin Cummings.</strong> The <a href="https://cummings.ee/">e.e. cummings free poetry archive</a>, <a href="https://palewi.re/posts/2021/05/02/ee-cummings-archive/">launched last week</a> by journalist <a href="https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/">Ben Welsh</a>, “aims to republish all of the author’s work as it gradually enters the public domain.” So far, it includes more than 100 poems, available to read online and <a href="https://cummings.ee/downloads/">as data files</a> that include each poem’s collection, title, first line, and full text. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/palewire/status/1389214308400173064">Welsh’s introductory Twitter thread</a>, which highlights technical details and volunteer contributions.</p>
