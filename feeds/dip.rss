the US Energy Information Administration “collects data on spent nuclear
fuel from all utilities that operate commercial nuclear reactors and
from all others that possess irradiated fuel from commercial nuclear
reactors.” The agency’s <a

href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47796">published
last year</a> with data through 2017, includes several basic tables. One
tallies the <a

amount of nuclear fuel discharged and stored at commercial sites</a>
since 1968, measured by <a

href="https://twitter.com/fatihguvenen/status/1576960664534683648">new</a>
“open-access international database that provides a wealth of micro
statistics on income inequality and income dynamics.” It was <a

<a href="https://www.grid-database.org/team">international team of
economists</a> using longitudinal administrative data and “designed from
ground up with a focus on comparability across countries.” The project’s
<a href="https://data.grid-database.org/">data access tool</a> provides
stats ranging from the widely-understood (e.g., share of income going to
the top 1%) to the more specialized (e.g., <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis">kurtosis</a> coefficients
of various income-change distributions). It currently covers 13
countries (although access to the UK’s data is listed as “coming soon”),
with timespans that typically stretch from the 1980s or 1990s to the
mid/late-2010s.</p>

<p><strong>Mine safety.</strong> The Department of Labor’s <a

“develops and enforces safety and health rules for all U.S. mines
regardless of size, number of employees, commodity mined, or method of
extraction.” Its <a

Retrieval System</a> provides a search interface and downloads of

<p><strong>Nuclear stockpiles.</strong> As of early 2022, a total of
nine countries possessed approximately 12,700 nuclear warheads,
according to <a
href="https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/">estimates
from the Federation of American Scientists</a>. Although “the exact
number of nuclear weapons in each country’s possession is a closely held
national secret,” the researchers say that “publicly available
information, careful analysis of historical records, and occasional
leaks” make the estimates possible, albeit “with significant
uncertainty.” The report includes each country’s current warhead count
and subtotals by status, as well as annual totals for each country since
1945. <strong>As seen in</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Flood insurance changes.</strong> FEMA <a
href="https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/risk-rating">recently
revamped</a> its method of pricing US flood insurance, aiming for “rates
that are actuarily sound, equitable, easier to understand and better
reflect a property’s flood risk.” A <a
href="https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/risk-rating/profiles">series
of datasets and dashboards</a> from the agency summarize the expected
changes in premiums, which began taking effect last year. They count the
number of policies for which monthly payments were projected to
increase/decrease by a given amount, bucketed into ten-dollar
increments, for each state, county, and ZIP code. <strong>As seen
