      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Historical land use, union election results, peace mission mandates, Federal Reserve Bank directors, and television castaways.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Historical land use.</strong> The <a href="https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/index.html">History Database of the Global Environment</a>, a project of the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, provides <a href="https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/landusedata/landcover/index-2.html">land use estimates that span 12,000 years</a> — from 10,000 BCE to the near-present. The <a href="https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/download/index-2.html">datasets</a> <a href="https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/ui/datasets/id/easy-dataset:74467">include</a> gridded, country-level, and regional estimates of cropland, pasture, grazing areas, and other typologies over time. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://clio-infra.eu/">Clio Infra</a> gathers “worldwide data on social, economic, and institutional indicators for the past five centuries,” including estimates of cropland, livestock, metal production, and more.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Union election results.</strong> The US National Labor Relations Board publishes a <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/reports/graphs-data/recent-election-results">searchable and downloadable database</a> that details the results of thousands of union elections <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/conduct-elections">the agency has conducted</a>, going back more than a decade. The records list the employer name and location, tally date and type, petitioned-for employee unit, proposed labor union(s), number of votes for and against those union(s), and more. [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/CoryMcCartan/status/1384012739626950656">Cory McCartan</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Peace mission mandates.</strong> A team led by political scientist <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraHellmuller">Sara Hellmüller</a> has <a href="https://www.peacemissions.info/">categorized the “evolving mandate tasks”</a> of all 121 United Nations peace missions between 1991 and 2020. The dataset identifies 41 kinds of tasks, which it <a href="https://www.peacemissions.info/dataset#definition">sorts into three categories</a>: “minimalist,” “moderate,” and “maximalist.” Minimalist tasks “reflect an approach that contents itself with absence of armed conflict,” while the maximalist approach “seeks to address root causes,” such as by supporting military reform and women’s rights. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/open-data-portal">Official UN peacekeeping data</a> and <a href="https://www.pcr.uu.se/data/geo-pko/">the Geocoded Peacekeeping Operations dataset</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-11-27-edition/">DIP 2019.11.27</a>). [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/rolandparis/status/1383070123179790338">Roland Paris</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Federal Reserve Bank directors.</strong> To examine diversity in the US <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed.htm">Federal Reserve System</a>, a team led by central bank–watchers <a href="https://lgst.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/petercb/">Peter Conti-Brown</a> and <a href="https://kalebnygaard.com/">Kaleb Nygaard</a> has <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/diversity-within-the-federal-reserve-system/">compiled a biographical dataset</a> of the nearly 2,000 people who have served as directors of the system’s <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system.htm">twelve Reserve Banks</a> between 1914 and 2019. The dataset expands the information available in official reports to include “race, gender, profession, education, age, time spent in position, and whether or not the directors later held a position on the FOMC.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Television castaways.</strong> Statistician <a href="https://twitter.com/danoehm">Dan Oehm</a> has <a href="https://gradientdescending.com/survivor-data-from-the-tv-series-in-r/">constructed a dataset</a> describing all 40 US seasons of <em>Survivor</em>, providing details on every contestant, challenge winner, individual vote, episode viewership, and more. You can access the data as an R package or an Excel file. [h/t <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/mu1ww9/survivor_r_package_a_collection_of_datasets/">u/antirabbit</a>]</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Water access points, foreign labor requests, congressional scandals, global mail, and the Tour de France.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Water access points.</strong> Launched <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/water-point-data-exchange-launched">in 2015</a>, the <a href="https://www.waterpointdata.org/">Water Point Data Exchange</a> today describes <a href="https://www.waterpointdata.org/access-data/">577,000+ specific water access points</a>: boreholes, hand-dug wells, protected springs, rainwater harvest tanks, and more. The platform gathers information from governments and their partners in 50+ countries — mostly in Africa, but also with 10,000+ data-points each in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Haiti, and India. The records indicate the coordinates of each access point, the date checked, water availability when checked, the water source and/or transport system, and other details. [h/t <a href="https://csvconf.com/speakers/#katy-sill-adam-kariv">Katy Sill and Adam Kariv</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Foreign labor requests.</strong> In order to hire foreign workers through the government’s <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs">H-1B, H-2A, and H-2B programs</a>, US employers need permission from the Department of Labor. The agency collects and publishes <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance">data on each “certification” request</a>, detailing the employer (name, location, industry, etc.), job position (title, pay, etc.), and approval status. The datasets go back more than a decade for each program and receive quarterly updates, the most recent being posted last week. <strong>Related</strong>: At BuzzFeed News, we used the data throughout our 2015/16 <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jessicagarrison/the-new-american-slavery-invited-to-the-us-foreign-workers-f">series</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jessicagarrison/all-you-americans-are-fired">investigating</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kenbensinger/the-coyote">the</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kenbensinger/the-pushovers">H-2 program</a>, and maintain a <a href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/H-2-certification-data/">dataset that standardizes key fields from the raw files</a>. [h/t <a href="https://eigenfoo.xyz/">George Ho</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Congressional scandals.</strong> In 2018, <a href="https://www.michaelgmiller.com/">Michael G. Miller</a> and <a href="https://www.brianhamel.me/">Brian T. Hamel</a> published <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912918781044">a study</a> examining how voters and donors responded to scandals embroiling members of the US House between 1980 and 2010, <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=4575902&amp;version=1.0">building on</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912912451144">the work of</a> <a href="https://www.bloomsburycollections.com/book/scandal-an-interdisciplinary-approach-to-the-consequences-outcomes-and-significance-of-political-scandals/preface">Scott Basinger and others</a>. They have since expanded <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/BID3QM">the dataset</a>, which now covers both the House and the Senate and extends through 2018, providing information on 316 legislator-scandal combinations (categorized as financial, sexual, political, or “other”) and their outcomes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Global mail.</strong> For more than a century, the <a href="https://www.upu.int/en/Home">Universal Postal Union</a> has collected and published statistics about the world’s postal systems. Online, you can <a href="https://www.upu.int/en/Universal-Postal-Union/Activities/Research-Publications/Postal-Statistics">query and export</a> country-level data — the number of letter-boxes and permanent post offices, operating revenue, total staff, and much more — going back to 1980. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12594">Jon C. Rogowski et al.</a> have used historical UPU reports to count the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/33K3EF">number of post offices per country between 1875 and 2007</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/">US post office locations, 1639–2000</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-04-07-edition/">DIP 2021.04.07</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Le Tour.</strong> On its official website, the Tour de France lists <a href="https://www.letour.fr/en/history">riders’ results in its famed bicycle race since 1903</a>. The site doesn’t provide downloads, but applied mathematician <a href="https://www.camminady.org/">Thomas Camminady</a> has <a href="https://github.com/camminady/LeTourDataSet">scraped it to build a CSV file</a> containing each finisher’s rank, time, team, and more.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Domestic terrorism, web crawls, COVID-19 in incarceration facilities, New York City languages, and CEO dismissals.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Domestic terrorism.</strong> The <a href="https://www.csis.org/programs/about-us">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a> has <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/military-police-and-rise-terrorism-united-states">analyzed</a> data on 980 domestic terrorism plots and attacks in the US from 1994 through January 2021, categorizing them as “violent far-right,” “violent far-left,” “religious,” “ethnonationalist,” or “other.” (The <a href="https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/210412_Jones_Methodology.pdf">project’s methodology</a> provides further details.) The researchers haven’t published the full dataset, but have allowed the Washington Post to publish <a href="https://github.com/wpinvestigative/csis_domestic_terrorism">a large slice of it</a> — a dozen columns for each incident, with dates, locations, type of target, and more. Based on its own research, the Post added eight more columns about the far-right attacks, which it used for a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/domestic-terrorism-data/">data-driven article on the topic</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/">The Global Terrorism Database</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-02-07-edition/">DIP 2018.02.07</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The web, crawled.</strong> The nonprofit <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> is “dedicated to providing a copy of the internet to internet researchers, companies and individuals at no cost for the purpose of research and analysis.” Over the past decade, it has gathered and shared <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/">petabytes of data</a> from its roughly-monthly web crawls. The <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/2021/03/february-march-2021-crawl-archive-now-available/">most recent</a>, completed in early March, contains 2.7 billion pages. <strong>Related</strong>: The University of Mannheim’s <a href="http://webdatacommons.org/">Web Data Commons</a> generates structured data from the crawls, including <a href="http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/schemaorgtables/">nearly 300 million rows</a> of information (on products, events, museums, and more) extracted from websites’ <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a> markup.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 in incarceration, by facility.</strong> For more than a year, the New York Times <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/prisons">collected data</a> on "coronavirus infections, deaths and testing for state and federal prisons; immigration detention centers; juvenile detention facilities; local, regional and reservation jails; and those in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.” On Friday, it published the <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/prisons/facilities.csv">case and death tolls for 2,000+ of these facilities</a>, as of March 2021. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/10/us/covid-prison-outbreak.html">The Times’ reporting and graphics based on the data</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/themarshallproject/COVID_prison_data">Weekly COVID-19 numbers for each state prison system</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-05-06-edition/">DIP 2020.05.06</a>), collected by the Marshall Project and Associated Press.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>New York City languages.</strong> The <a href="https://elalliance.org/">Endangered Language Alliance</a>’s <a href="https://languagemap.nyc/">Languages of New York City map</a> highlights nearly 700 languages and dialects spoken in NYC and nearby counties. For each language, it indicates a number of significant sites where it is or has been spoken. The project’s <a href="https://languagemap.nyc/Data">downloadable dataset</a> lists each site's status and neighborhood or city, plus the language’s linguistic family, countries of origin, and estimated number of global speakers.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Global abortion rates, pandemic-era central banking, the Household Pulse Survey, news homepages, and rainforest soundscapes.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Global abortion rates.</strong> The Guttmacher Institute’s new <a href="https://osf.io/5k7fp/">Global Abortion Incidence Dataset</a> gathers annual abortion statistics for more than 100 countries — for as many years between 1990 and 2018 as possible. The dataset also indicates the sources for the figures, “whether spontaneous abortions are included, whether or not the data are considered complete and the reason behind it, the marital status of the sample for studies and surveys,” and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://osf.io/kthnf/">Pregnancies, births, and abortions by US state and age group</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-10-28-edition/">DIP 2020.10.28</a>), also from Guttmacher.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Central banks vs. the pandemic.</strong> Researchers at the <a href="https://www.bis.org/">Bank for International Settlements</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-08-12-edition/">DIP 2020.08.12</a>) have compiled a <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work934.htm">dataset of central banks’ policy responses to the coronavirus pandemic</a>. It covers more than 900 announcements by 39 central banks, grouped by monetary tool: interest rates, reserve policies, lending operations, foreign exchange, and asset purchases. The researchers also “provide further details relevant to each type of tool, such as the maturity and whether the instrument was new to the central bank or not.” [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlosCantug/status/1376884559237758976">Carlos Cantú</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The pandemic vs. US households.</strong> The Census Bureau’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html">Household Pulse Survey</a> “is a 20-minute online survey studying how the coronavirus pandemic is impacting households across the country from a social and economic perspective,” and asks questions about food security, housing, telework, and more. It has collected more than 2 million responses since last April, with results published on a rolling basis via <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html">microdata files</a>, <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html">statistical tables</a>, and <a href="https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/">interactive graphics</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: The Urban Institute has been <a href="https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/census-pulse-public-use-files-questionnaire-two">collating and standardizing the data files</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>News homepages.</strong> Since January 2019, software engineer <a href="https://nrjones8.me/">Nick Jones</a> has been <a href="https://github.com/nrjones8/website-screenshotter">capturing</a> hourly screenshots of five news sites’ homepages: The New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and CNN. You can <a href="https://nrjones8.github.io/news-archive-explorer/">browse the images online</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nrjones8/website-screenshotter#how-to-access-screenshots">download them from predictable URLs</a>. <strong>Note</strong>: “This project is unaffiliated with <a href="http://www.pastpages.org/">PastPages</a>, a similar effort that took screenshots from 2012 to 2018 from a much wider range of news websites.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rainforest soundscapes.</strong> As part of its “efforts to better understand the ecology of forest elephant movements, and the spatial and temporal pattern of poaching,” the <a href="https://elephantlisteningproject.org/">Elephant Listening Project</a> has been <a href="https://elephantlisteningproject.org/arus/">collecting audio 24/7</a> from 50 locations in the Republic of the Congo and <a href="https://elephantlisteningproject.org/congo-soundscapes-public-database/">publishing the raw recordings</a> — ”more than 1 million hours of the sounds of birds, primates, insects, frogs, you name it. <em>If it makes sound, we record it</em>.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Post offices.</strong> Historian <a href="https://www.cameronblevins.org/">Cameron Blevins</a> has released a <a href="https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/">dataset</a> of 166,000+ post offices operating in the US between 1639 and 2000. It includes their years of service and precise/approximate geocoordinates, “making it one of the most fine-grained and expansive datasets currently available for studying the historical geography of the United States.” The project <a href="https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/data-biography/">builds on research by the late Richard W. Helbock</a> and provides the data-foundation for Blevins’s new book, <a href="https://www.cameronblevins.org/paper-trails/"><em>Paper Trails: The US Post and the Making of the American West</em></a>, and <a href="https://gossamernetwork.com/">companion website</a>. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/historying/status/1377336343676608513">Blevins’s introductory Twitter thread</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>US coronavirus case details, high-resolution population densities, electoral gender quotas, EU merger decisions, and dried beans.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>US coronavirus case details.</strong> Last week, the US CDC began publishing a <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4">new, geographically-specific COVID-19 “case surveillance” dataset</a>. Each of the 22 million rows represents a (<a href="https://github.com/CDCgov/covid_case_privacy_review">de-identified</a>) coronavirus case, accounting for roughly 70% of the country’s current official case count. The details include (where available) the person’s county and state of residence; age, sex, race, and ethnicity; “presence of any underlying medical conditions and risk behaviors”; and whether the person was hospitalized and/or died. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://coviddatadispatch.com/2021/03/28/new-more-local-data-from-the-cdc/">Betsy Ladyzhets writes at the COVID-19 Data Dispatch</a>, “After months of no state-by-state demographic data from the federal government, we now have county-by-county demographic data. This is a pretty big deal!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>High-resolution population densities.</strong> “Using a mixture of machine learning techniques, high-resolution satellite imagery, and population data,” <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/mapping-the-world-to-help-aid-workers-with-weakly-semi-supervised-learning">researchers at Facebook and Columbia University</a> have “mapped hundreds of millions of structures distributed across vast areas and then used that to extrapolate the local population density.” The <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/population-density-maps/">project</a>, which <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2016/02/21/core-data/connecting-the-world-with-better-maps/">began half a decade ago</a>, now provides <a href="https://data.humdata.org/search?organization=facebook&amp;q=%22high%20resolution%20population%20density%22">population density datasets</a> covering much of the world.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Electoral gender quotas.</strong> Many countries apply <a href="https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/quotas">gender quotas</a> to their parliamentary elections, typically by reserving a certain number of seats for women or by regulating political parties’ candidate lists. In other instances, parties have instituted voluntary quotas. The <a href="https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas">Gender Quotas Database</a> categorizes these rules <a href="https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/database">for more than 120 nations</a>, and provides additional details through its country profile pages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EU merger decisions.</strong> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3366915">Pauline Affeldt et al.</a> have compiled a <a href="https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.670982.en/pages/research_data_center_for_business_and_organizational_data__rdc-bo.html">quarter century of merger control decisions</a> by the European Commission’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/dgs/competition/index_en.htm">Directorate-General for Competition</a> — decisions relating to 5,000+ cases and 31,000+ product/market combinations between 1990 and 2014.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Disasters, nursing-home staffing, Brazil’s vaccination registry, probable news quotations, and British millionaires of the late 1920s.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Disasters.</strong> The <a href="https://www.emdat.be/">Emergency Events Database</a> (EM-DAT) contains “essential core data on the occurrence and effects of more than 21,000 [natural and technological] disasters in the world, from 1900 to present.” It <a href="https://www.emdat.be/explanatory-notes">focuses on</a> disasters that have caused 10+ human deaths, affected 100+ people, sparked a state of emergency, and/or prompted a request for international assistance. Where known, the <a href="https://public.emdat.be/">public dataset</a> (registration required) indicates each disaster’s location, type, start/end dates, and estimated damages; the number of people killed, injured, made homeless, or otherwise affected; and more. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/pend-gdis-1960-2018">The Geocoded Disasters (GDIS) Dataset</a> (registration required) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00846-6">provides spatial coordinates</a> for the natural disasters in EM-DAT from 1960 to 2018.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nursing-home staffing.</strong> The US Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services requires nursing homes to submit <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/NursingHomeQualityInits/Staffing-Data-Submission-PBJ">detailed payroll information</a>, which the agency converts into <a href="https://data.cms.gov/browse?q=daily+nurse+staffing">public-use files</a> that <a href="https://data.cms.gov/Special-Programs-Initiatives-Long-Term-Care-Facili/PBJ-Public-Use-Files-Data-Documentation/ygny-gzks">summarize</a> daily staffing levels at each facility. The files count employee and contract hours for dozens of types of staff, ranging from administrators to respiratory therapists. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/business/nursing-homes-ratings-medicare-covid.html">Maggots, Rape and Yet Five Stars: How U.S. Ratings of Nursing Homes Mislead the Public</a>,” a recent New York Times investigation that uses the data in several ways.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Brazil’s vaccination registry.</strong> Brazil’s health ministry is publishing <a href="https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/en/dataset/covid-19-vacinacao">granular data from its COVID-19 vaccination registry</a>, with data on more than 12 million doses administered so far. For each dose, it indicates the patient’s date of birth, sex, race, location, and eligibility group; the vaccine name, manufacturer, and lot; the date and location of vaccination; and more.

<p><strong>Probable news quotations.</strong> <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4277311">Quotebank</a> is “an open corpus of 178 million quotations attributed to the speakers who uttered them, extracted from 162 million English news articles published between 2008 and 2020.” Its authors <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437963.3441760">used machine learning</a> to identify the quotes and speakers, “correctly [attributing] 86.9% of quotations in our experiments.” The five most-quoted people: Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton, and Narendra Modi. [h/t <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:arnicas/">Lynn Cherny</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Early British millionaires.</strong> Business historian <a href="https://www.henley.ac.uk/people/professor-peter-scott">Peter Scott</a> has <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ehr.13025">reconstructed a dataset</a> of Britain’s “<a href="https://ehs.org.uk/britains-inter-war-super-rich-the-1928-9-millionaire-list-2/">inter-war super-rich</a>.” Scott started with an official (but mostly nameless) list of 438 “millionaires” (which tax authorities defined as people with annual incomes above £50,000) from 1928/29, and then cross-referenced the entries with other sources to identify 291 men and 28 women who fit the criteria.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Police misconduct settlements.</strong> Reporters at FiveThirtyEight and The Marshall Project filed freedom-of-information requests to 50 US cities, asking for data on all civil lawsuits against their police departments/officers “that resulted in a monetary legal settlement” in 2010–2019 — including incident and settlement dates, plaintiff and defendant names, allegation descriptions, amounts awarded, and more. They received <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/police-settlements">full or partial data from 31 of those cities</a>, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends/">found that</a> total payouts <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/02/22/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-that-s-where-the-accountability-ends">exceeded $3 billion</a>. <strong>Don’t miss</strong>: The data repository’s “<a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/police-settlements#words-of-caution">words of caution</a>,” which discourage comparisons between cities. <strong>Related</strong>: Coauthor Laura Bronner’s <a href="https://twitter.com/laurabronner/status/1363961281905106956">introductory Twitter thread</a>.

<p><strong>Congressional e-newsletters.</strong> <a href="https://www.dcinbox.com/about">For more than a decade</a>, political scientist <a href="https://www.lindseycormack.com/">Lindsey Cormack</a>’s <a href="https://www.dcinbox.com/">DCinbox</a> project has collected “every official e-newsletter sent by sitting members of the U.S. House and Senate.” You can search the corpus online and also <a href="https://www.lindseycormack.com/dcinbox-data-downloads">download all the emails</a> as a series of CSV files, grouped by month. For each of the 130,000+ mailings, the files provide the date, subject, body, and sender’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/member-bioguide-ids">Bioguide</a> ID. (April 2020 was the highest-volume month, with more than 2,300 messages, nearly all of them mentioning the coronavirus.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>California vaccine availability.</strong> The volunteer-driven <a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/">VaccinateCA</a> project calls “hundreds of potential [COVID-19] vaccination sites daily, asking them if they have the vaccine and if so to whom they will administer it to and how to get an appointment.” You can examine the results on their website, and also use <a href="https://docs.vaccinateca.com/reference">their API</a> to access the latest data, which includes status reports on every California county, 20+ health care providers, and thousands of potential vaccination sites. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://blog.vaccinateca.com/what-weve-learned-so-far/">What We’ve Learned (So Far)</a>.” [h/t <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/28/vaccinateca/">Simon Willison</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Illegal cheetah commerce.</strong> A team of conservationists <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921001323">has compiled</a> a <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/84k92j4n3y">decade of data on illegal cheetah sales and ownership</a>, drawing from “over 300 sources, including direct communications with field informants, veterinarians, and cheetah owners,” court records, social media, and more. The dataset covers 1,800+ cases — including both actual seizures and alleged/suspected incidents — involving 4,000+ cheetahs or cheetah parts/derivatives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Soil.</strong> <a href="https://soilgrids.org/">SoilGrids</a> “uses state-of-the-art machine learning methods to map the spatial distribution of soil properties across the globe,” including organic carbon density, pH, clay content, and more. The maps use data from the <a href="https://www.isric.org/explore/wosis">World Soil Information Service</a>, which standardizes millions of soil records. Both projects are run by the <a href="https://isric.org/">International Soil Reference and Information Centre</a>, which also catalogs <a href="https://isric.org/explore/soil-geographic-databases">dozens of public-access soil datasets</a>.
