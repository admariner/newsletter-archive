      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The coronavirus economy, early voting registrations, COVID clusters, subway accessibility, and twelve men using computers.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The coronavirus economy.</strong> Opportunity Insights’ <a href="https://tracktherecovery.org/">Economic Tracker</a> “combines anonymized data from leading private companies – from credit card processors to payroll firms – to provide a real-time picture of indicators such as employment rates, consumer spending, and job postings across counties, industries, and income groups.” Small business revenue, for instance, appears to be down about 55% in Boston, compared to the beginning of the year. The <a href="https://github.com/Opportunitylab/EconomicTracker">project’s GitHub page</a> provides aggregated data corresponding to each of the charts and graphs. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/data/">Opportunity Insights’ extensive datasets on economic mobility</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-06-12-edition">DIP 2019.06.12</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Voter registration.</strong> At least three states publish monthly, machine-readable statistics on new voter registrations: <a href="https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/voter-registration-statistics/voter-registration-reportsxlsx/">Florida</a>, <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registration-statistics/">Virginia</a>, and <a href="https://dl.ncsbe.gov/?prefix=data/voterstats/">North Carolina</a>. <a href="https://elections.maryland.gov/voter_registration/stats.html">Maryland</a> and the <a href="https://www.dcboe.org/Data-Resources-Forms/Voter-Registration-Stats">District of Columbia</a> publish similar data as PDF tables. A <a href="https://electioninnovation.org/new-voter-registrations-in-2020/">recent report</a> by <a href="https://electioninnovation.org/">Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research</a> analyzed pandemic-era registrations, using that data plus numbers obtained from Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, and Texas. The analysis found a “steep decline in new registrations,” largely attributable to social distancing measures and DMV closures. To accompany <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voter-registrations-are-way-way-down-during-the-pandemic/">an article on the topic</a>, FiveThirtyEight has compiled CEIR’s counts for those 12 states, for the first five months of 2016 and 2020, <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/voter-registration">into a simple CSV</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COVID clusters.</strong> A <a href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-83">team of researchers in the UK</a> has been gathering <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16wtnHe4hM6I7TFHXVpLXY8R4GAUzAJ-7NWbKIVvsVuA/edit">data on COVID-19 “transmission events”</a> that have resulted in clusters of cases, based on various official, scholarly, and news reports. For each of the 250+ events listed so far, the dataset specifies the setting (e.g., “work,” “household,” “religious,” “elderly care”), whether it was indoors or outdoors, geographical location, number of cases involved, and more. The New York Times has also been tracking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#clusters">the location and size of COVID-19 clusters in the US</a> — so far, more than 1,700 clusters with at least 50 cases. The NYT doesn’t provide a download button, but its webpage loads the data from a JSON file.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>New policing bills, Indigenous lands, The Gay Guides, coronavirus-era child care, and Ancient Rome.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>New policing bills.</strong> The <a href="https://www.ncsl.org">National Conference of State Legislatures</a> has built a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/legislative-responses-for-policing.aspx">database of state-level policing bills and executive orders</a> introduced since May 25, the day George Floyd was killed. The database covers proposed bills on “oversight and data, training, standards and certification, use of force, technology, policing alternatives and collaboration, [...] and other timely issues.” So far, it contains brief descriptions, author information, statuses, and last-activity dates for more than 250 pieces of legislation in 25 states and DC. Although the database does not provide downloads, its HTML output is highly structured. <strong>Related</strong>: Last week, The Marshall Project’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Weihua_Li1">Weihua Li</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HumeraLodhi">Humera Lodhi</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/sharmad23">Damini Sharma</a> <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/06/18/which-states-are-taking-on-police-reform-after-george-floyd">analyzed the database and put the bills in context</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Indigenous lands.</strong> <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Native-Land.ca</a> maps the historical geographic extents of Indigenous territories in North America, Australia, New Zealand, parts of South America, and elsewhere. The <a href="https://native-land.ca/api-docs/">project’s datasets</a> cover 1,400+ territories, 900+ languages, and 800+ related treaties, drawn from <a href="https://native-land.ca/resources/">a wide range of resources</a>. It was launched in 2015 by programmer <a href="http://victortemprano.com">Victor Temprano</a> and is <a href="https://native-land.ca/about/">now run by a not-for-profit organization with a board of directors</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: Earlier this year, High Country News published <a href="https://www.landgrabu.org">Land-Grab Universities</a>, a “two-year inquiry into the origin of wealth that undergirds the nation’s system of higher education,” accompanied by a <a href="https://www.hcn.org/articles/indigenous-affairs-education-how-we-investigated-the-land-grant-university-system">detailed methodology</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HCN-Digital-Projects/landgrabu-data">dataset</a> spanning nearly 11 million acres of expropriated Indigenous land.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Gay Guides.</strong> <a href="https://www.mappingthegayguides.org">Mapping the Gay Guides</a> “aims to understand often ignored queer geographies using the Damron Address Books, an early but longstanding travel guide aimed at gay men since the early 1960s.” The project — <a href="https://www.mappingthegayguides.org/2020/02/announcing-the-launch-of-mapping-the-gay-guides/">launched earlier this year</a> and <a href="https://mappingthegayguides.org/about/">led by</a> historians <a href="https://mappingthegayguides.org/regan/">Amanda Regan</a> and <a href="https://mappingthegayguides.org/gonzaba/">Eric Gonzaba</a> — includes an <a href="https://mappingthegayguides.org/map/">interactive map</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MappingtheGayGuides/MGG-Data">downloadable dataset</a>, <a href="https://mappingthegayguides.org/methodology/">methodology</a>, and <a href="https://mappingthegayguides.org/ethics/">ethics statement</a>. It already covers more than 22,000 entries in more than 30 states, with plans for further expansion.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Confederate monuments, more protest data, the Green Books, sentences for measuring bias, and a few hundred penguins.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Confederate monuments.</strong> For several years, the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>’s “<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/data-projects/whose-heritage">Whose Heritage?</a>” project has been gathering and mapping information on “<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy">public symbols of the Confederacy</a>,” such as monuments, place names, official holidays, commemorative license plates, and municipal seals. For each of the 1,800+ entries, the project’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17ps4aqRyaIfpu7KdGsy2HRZaaQiXUfLrpUbaR9yS51E/edit">dataset</a> indicates the type of monument/symbol, its location, sponsor, year dedicated, and (if applicable) year removed.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>More protest data.</strong> <a href="https://countlove.org/">CountLove.org</a> has been using news reports to quantify protest events in the US since 2017. Its <a href="https://countlove.org/faq.html">downloadable dataset</a> currently contains more than 27,000 events and provides each event’s date, location, and approximate number of attendees. The events are also tagged with one or more topics, such as <em>civil rights</em>, <em>healthcare,</em> <em>for racial justice</em>, and <em>against regulation</em>. The site’s <a href="https://countlove.org/search.html">search/mapping tool</a> lets you to filter by those tags, and also for “curated protest data for a more compassionate country.” <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.tommyleung.com/about.htm">Tommy Leung</a> and <a href="https://www.nathanntg.com/">Nathan Perkins</a> <a href="https://www.tommyleung.com/countLove/index.htm">describe how they built the project</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Green Books.</strong> The New York Public Library has digitized <a href="https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/the-green-book#/?tab=about">more than 20 volumes of the Green Book</a> —  a series of travelers’ guides, <a href="https://www.nypl.org/blog/2015/03/24/schomburg-treasures-green-book">published from the 1930s to 1960s by US postal worker Victor Green</a>, that listed hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and other establishments where Black visitors would be safe and welcome. The library has <a href="https://github.com/NYPL-publicdomain/greenbooks">converted its digital copies into semi-structured text</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NYPL-publicdomain/greenbooks/tree/master/geojson">turned the 1947 edition into a fully-structured dataset</a>. The University of South Carolina has built a <a href="https://digital.library.sc.edu/collections/the-negro-travelers-green-book-1956/">dataset of the 1,500+ listings in the 1956 edition</a>. Inn 2015, NYPL Labs combined both years’ datasets into a <a href="https://publicdomain.nypl.org/greenbook-map/">tool to map the locations and plan routes with them</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sentences for measuring bias.</strong> <a href="https://stereoset.mit.edu/">StereoSet</a> aims to measure biases toward stereotypes — as they relate to profession, gender, race, and religion — in statistical language models, using <a href="https://github.com/moinnadeem/StereoSet">a dataset containing thousands of sentences</a>, each with several variations. Through the project’s <a href="https://stereoset.mit.edu/explore/dev/">online data explorer</a>, you can examine the sentences and see how some popular language models perform.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Black Lives Matter protests, police violence at the protests, police reforms and union contracts, police militarization, and tech’s response.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Black Lives Matter protests.</strong> An unnamed geospatial analyst <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/gx8uoa/mapping_george_floyd_black_lives_matter_protests/">has been mapping</a> “every town or city I can find where a George Floyd / Black Lives Matter protest, action, or vigil has occurred since May 25” — <a href="https://www.creosotemaps.com/blm2020/">more than 2,600 so far</a>. The <a href="https://www.creosotemaps.com/blm2020/json/">data files powering the map</a> include each city’s name, state/region, country, coordinates, and the date it was added. <strong>Related</strong>: For <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/black-lives-matter-evidence-that-policecaused-deaths-predict-protest-activity/BFA2E74F4BCB25C3C222807E8B1111D4/share/53d6d67c798695fc19688bd571777e433fca550d">a study of the relationship between police-caused deaths and demonstrations</a>, Williamson et al. built <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/L2GSK6">a dataset of Black Lives Matter protests in 2014 and 2015</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Police violence at the BLM protests.</strong> Several groups are collecting examples of disproportionate police responses to the protests against police brutality. <a href="https://watchwatch.org/">One such collection</a>, <a href="https://time.com/5849839/police-brutality-george-floyd-protests-spreadsheet/">spurred by criminal defense attorney T. Greg Doucette</a>, has compiled hundreds of instances of “unnecessary violence by law enforcement officers against civilians”; for each one, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YmZeSxpz52qT-10tkCjWOwOGkQqle7Wd1P7ZM1wMW0E/edit">underlying spreadsheet</a> provides the city and state of the incident, links to visual documentation on Twitter and YouTube, and a short description. <a href="https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality">Another collection</a>, which emerged from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2020PoliceBrutality/">/r/2020PoliceBrutality subreddit</a> and seeks “to accumulate and contextualize evidence of police brutality during the 2020 George Floyd protests,” also includes incident dates, an <a href="https://846policebrutality.com/">interactive map</a>, and APIs. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2020/06/05/visualizing-police-violence-against-journalists-at-protests-across-the-us/">Bellingcat</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/05/im-getting-shot-attacks-on-journalists-surge-in-us-protests">The Guardian</a> have compiled <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F7Q-XoCoHzb_cX28ARCL4BMsuxp3EpkouUDJ2cRSjOQ/edit">a spreadsheet</a> of 140+ “reports of arrests, violence, and intimidation against journalists” at the protests.

<p><strong>Police reforms and union contracts.</strong> <a href="https://www.joincampaignzero.org/">Campaign Zero</a>’s <a href="https://8cantwait.org/">8cantwait.org</a> advocates for eight specific reforms to curtail police officers’ use of force, including bans on chokeholds, requiring de-escalation tactics, and establishing comprehensive reporting. The organization has compiled <a href="https://useofforceproject.org/database">the use of force policies for 100 large police departments</a>, and <a href="https://8cantwait.org/compare/">determined whether they’ve instituted these reforms</a>.

<p><strong>Police militarization.</strong> The US Defense Logistic Agency’s <a href="https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/Offers/Reutilization/LawEnforcement/">Law Enforcement Support Office</a> sends surplus Department of Defense equipment to local law enforcement agencies, through an arrangement known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1033_program">1033 program</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Census response rates.</strong> As it has in the past, the US Census Bureau is encouraging residents to <a href="https://2020census.gov/en/ways-to-respond.html">respond to the 2020 Census’s mailed questionnaire</a>, which reduces the need for in-person census-taking. The agency calculates these "self-response" rates all the way down to individual Census tracts, and provides that data <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/data/2020map/2020/">as a CSV</a> and via <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-response-rates.html">its API</a>. Those datasets, however, only represent the latest numbers, so researchers at the CUNY’s <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUR">Center for Urban Research</a> have been <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qrwrdkmjb3fjmg5/AAAaxYr9yeU9hBQMJcggriuEa?dl=0">creating daily snapshots</a>, which they’re also <a href="https://www.censushardtocountmaps2020.us/">mapping and analyzing for the public</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Center-for-Urban-Research/CUR-research-initiatives/Census-2020-Self-Response-Data-Questions-and-Answers">The Center’s FAQ for the data</a>.

<p><strong>More excess mortality data.</strong> <a href="http://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-05-20-edition">Last week’s newsletter</a> featured the <a href="https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-excess-deaths-tracker">data and code</a> that The Economist is using <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/16/tracking-covid-19-excess-deaths-across-countries">to estimate excess deaths due to COVID-19</a>. Also last week: The New York Times began publishing <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/excess-deaths">the data</a> behind its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html">similar-but-different estimates</a>. And earlier this month, the team at the <a href="https://www.mortality.org/">Human Mortality Database</a> launched its <a href="https://www.mortality.org/Public/STMF_DOC/STMFNote.pdf">Short-term Mortality Fluctuations data series</a>, which provides “user-friendly access to detailed data on mortality by week, sex, and aggregated age group” for more than a dozen countries.

<p><strong>Ranked-choice votes.</strong> The website <a href="https://ranked.vote/">ranked.vote</a>, built by quantitative analyst <a href="https://paulbutler.org/">Paul Butler</a>, standardizes and visualizes the detailed results of a few dozen elections — in Maine, San Francisco, Santa Fe, and Burlington — that have used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting">ranked-choice voting</a>, where voters can list their preferred candidates in sequential order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Interwar literary lending.</strong> From 1919 to 1941, Sylvia Beach ran <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_and_Company_(bookstore)">Shakespeare and Company</a>, the legendary Paris bookstore. It featured a lending library, whose members included writers such as Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Simone de Beauvoir, and Ernest Hemingway. Princeton University’s <a href="https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/">Shakespeare and Company Project</a> has digitized <a href="https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/sources/">hundreds of the library’s lending cards and logbooks</a>, and has made the data available to <a href="https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/members/">explore</a> and <a href="https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/about/data/">download</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Seashells.</strong> A team of researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0230-3">has built</a> a dataset that characterizes 29,622 samples of shells from 7,894 water-dwelling species.

<p><strong>Excess deaths.</strong> The Economist has published <a href="https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-excess-deaths-tracker">the data</a> behind its <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/16/tracking-covid-19-excess-deaths-across-countries">estimates of excess deaths due to COVID-19</a>. The data repository currently covers 20 countries; it provides recent weekly/monthly death totals, officially-counted COVID-19 death, and average historical death totals for the same time periods. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/J_CD_T/status/1261625814854045696">Data journalist James Tozer’s introductory Twitter thread</a>.

<p><strong>Trade agreements.</strong> The <a href="https://www.designoftradeagreements.org">Design of Trade Agreements</a> database collects information about customs unions, free trade agreements, and other similar treaties signed between 1948 and 2018. It currently includes more than 800 agreements, plus additional negotiations, accessions, withdrawals, consolidations, and amendments.

      <description>Employee protections, COVID stimulus recipients, national wildernesses, EU legislative edits, and millions of Iowa liquor purchases.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Employee protections, COVID stimulus recipients, national wildernesses, EU legislative edits, and millions of Iowa liquor purchases.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Employee protections.</strong> The UN International Labour Organization’s <a href="https://eplex.ilo.org/">Employment Protection Legislation Database</a> tracks “legal information on the regulation of temporary contracts and employment termination at the initiative of the employer,” on a national-regulatory level. The database quantifies and categorizes regulations under nine “themes” — including grounds for dismissal, procedures for collective dismissals, severance pay, and redress — and for more than 100 countries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COVID stimulus recipients.</strong> The nonprofit <a href="https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/about-us">Good Jobs First</a> has <a href="https://covidstimuluswatch.org/blog/2020-04/covid-stimulus-watch-new-website-documents-accountability-track-records-cares-act">launched</a> <a href="https://covidstimuluswatch.org/">COVID Stimulus Watch</a>, which is gathering data on the grants and loans that have been provided to corporations through the $2 trillion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_Aid,_Relief,_and_Economic_Security_Act">CARES Act</a>. So far, the dataset contains more than 5,700 awards, totalling $54 billion. The records are based on information from public financial filings, press releases, and, <a href="https://covidstimuluswatch.org/blog/2020-05/covid-stimulus-watch-adds-5000-healthcare-provider-awards">most recently</a>, <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Administrative/HHS-Provider-Relief-Fund/kh8y-3es6">data from the government’s healthcare-focused Provider Relief Fund</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>National wildernesses.</strong> Since the passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964, the US federal government has established 803 official wilderness areas, which cover more than 111 million acres. They’re all part of the <a href="https://wilderness.net/learn-about-wilderness/fast-facts/default.php">National Wilderness Preservation System</a>, co-managed by the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Forest Service. The University of Montana’s <a href="https://wilderness.net/default.php">Wilderness.net</a> brings data about each of the agencies’ wildernesses into one place, where it can be <a href="https://umontana.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a415bca07f0a4bee9f0e894b0db5c3b6">explored via an interactive map</a> and <a href="https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/gis-gps.php">downloaded in bulk</a>. For each wilderness, the dataset provides its name, description, boundaries, acreage, year designated, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EU legislative edits.</strong> Computer science graduate student <a href="https://victorkristof.me/">Victor Kristof</a> has built a <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3757714">dataset of 450,000 legislative edits</a> proposed by members of the EU parliament from 2009 to 2019. For each proposed edit, the dataset points to the relevant legislation, names the parlimentarian, and indicates whether the edit was accepted. In an accompanying <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3366423.3380041">academic paper</a>, Kristof et al. describe the dataset’s construction and “propose a model for predicting the success of such edits.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Millions of Iowa liquor purchases.</strong> Iowa’s Alcoholic Beverages Division publishes <a href="https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy">itemized data on all liquor sales</a> by grocery/liquor/convenience-type stores since January 2002 — more than 18 million purchases in all. For each purchase, the dataset includes the specific kind, amount, and cost of the liquor, plus the date and location of the sale. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-08-07-edition">State liquor prices</a> (DIP 2019.08.07).

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Coronavirus and race, COVID-19 in prisons, “essential” NYC construction, space dollars, and Love Island.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Coronavirus and race.</strong> Last week, the COVID Tracking Project (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-03-18-edition">DIP 2020.03.18</a>) <a href="https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking/status/1254909756742852608">launched</a> a beta release of its <a href="https://covidtracking.com/race">COVID Racial Data Tracker</a>, built in collaboration with American University’s <a href="https://antiracismcenter.com/">Antiracist Research &amp; Policy Center</a>. The tracker collects demographic statistics, now published by most states, that disaggregate the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths by race and/or ethnicity. “This is a challenging dataset to compile and code, and our data sources remain in flux, but we offer this beta release for full transparency,” the project’s organizers write; they’re seeking feedback “as we work toward building a complete dataset and getting it into our API and onto the website.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 in prisons.</strong> The Marshall Project has been <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons">tracking COVID-19 cases and deaths in US prisons</a>. To compile <a href="https://github.com/themarshallproject/COVID_prison_data">that dataset</a>, every week the publication’s reporters ask each state prison system and the federal Bureau of Prisons “for the total number of coronavirus tests administered to its staff members and prisoners, the cumulative number who tested positive among staff and prisoners, and the numbers of deaths for each group.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Essential NYC construction sites.</strong> New York City’s Department of Buildings has been publishing a <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/html/essential-active-construction.html">dataset and interactive map</a> of construction sites deemed “essential,” and thus <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/about/essential-construction-faq.page">eligible to continue work</a> during the coronavirus pandemic. The current list covers more than 6,700 sites, including more than 1,200 at schools, 1,000 for public housing, and 250 related to health care.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Space dollars.</strong> <a href="https://www.planetary.org/get-involved/be-a-space-advocate/become-an-expert/planetary-exploration-budget-dataset.html">The Planetary Science Budget Dataset</a> “integrates the spending history, by year, of every NASA planetary science mission and related activities.” It also calculates funding by destination (e.g., Mars, Venus, the moon, etc.), and annual budget breakdowns for individual missions. The dataset is maintained by <a href="https://www.planetary.org/about/">The Planetary Society</a>, a nonprofit founded 40 years ago by Carl Sagan, Louis Friedman, and Bruce Murray — and now led by Bill Nye.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Parlimentary speeches, COVID-19 preprints, mobility indicators, US retail, and poems by kids.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Six million parliamentary speeches.</strong> <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/L4OAKN">ParlSpeech V2</a> contains 6.3 million parliamentary speeches from nine countries: Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The dataset, created by political scientists <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/christianrauh/">Christian Rauh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/janschwalbach">Jan Schwalbach</a>, includes the full text of each speech, plus the date, speaker, and the speaker’s party. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/HixNouryRolandEPdata.HTM">Roll call votes from the European Parliament’s first six terms</a> (1979–2009). [h/t <a href="https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData/pull/5">Robert Stelzle</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 preprints.</strong> Preprints — academic papers published online before they’ve gone through traditional peer review — have become a common way for scientists to disseminate their coronavirus-related findings. So researchers <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7582-6339">Nicholas Fraser</a> and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5965-6560">Bianca Kramer</a> have begun compiling a <a href="https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/covid19_preprints">dataset of more than 6,000 COVID-19 preprints</a>. For each paper, the dataset includes the title, abstract, DOI, date posted, and the hosting repository (such as <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/">medRxiv</a>, the most common so far).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mobility indicators.</strong> Tech companies have repurposed some of the data they collect from you into explorable, downloadable datasets that estimate the degree to which movement patterns have (or haven’t) changed in recent months. Among them: Apple, which is <a href="https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility">quantifying requests for directions</a>; Google, which is <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/">counting visits to places such as grocery stores and transit station</a>; and Descartes Labs, which is <a href="https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19">tracking smartphone movements</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: Sociologist <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/about/">Kieran Healy</a> recently <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2020/04/23/apples-covid-mobility-data/">found and explained</a> a curious February 17 spike in Apple’s data.

<p> </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A COVID policy tracker–tracker, every US Census question since 1790, chemical weapons in Syria, NYC sidewalks, and crowdsourced moral judgments.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tracking the COVID policy trackers.</strong> Economics graduate student <a href="https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner">Lukas Lehner</a> has gathered, <a href="https://twitter.com/LukasLehner_/status/1251048564899397632">with help from the hive-mind</a>, a list of <a href="https://lukaslehner.github.io/covid19policytrackers/">dozens of websites and datasets tracking policy responses</a> to the COVID-19 pandemic – a few that have been mentioned in DIP, plus many that haven’t. Lehner’s tracker-tracker groups the resources into several topic areas, summarizes them, and indicates their data formats. [h/t <a href="https://f.briatte.org/">François Briatte</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Every Census question, ever.</strong> Programmer <a href="https://github.com/anbnyc">Alec Barrett</a> has built a spreadsheet listing <a href="https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/census-history">every question asked on every decennial US Census</a> since 1790 — more than 900 items overall. In addition to the questions themselves, the dataset describes the subgroups of people questioned and the types of answers expected. <strong>Related</strong>: The dataset powers “<a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/03/census-history/">The Evolution of the American Census</a>,” Barrett’s interactive exploration of how the questions have changed over time, and what they say about America.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Chemical weapons attacks in Syria.</strong> “Building on years of painstaking work alongside our Syrian and international partners,” the <a href="https://chemicalweapons.gppi.net/">Global Public Policy Institute</a> “has compiled the most comprehensive dataset of incidents of chemical weapons use in Syria to date.” The institute has published a <a href="https://chemicalweapons.gppi.net/data-portal/">new interactive data portal</a> to display the data on 345 attacks between 2012 and 2019. The data fields include the date and time of the attack, location, chemical agent, munition type and method of delivery, perpetrator, confidence rating, and more.

<p><strong>NYC sidewalks, narrow and broad.</strong> Urban planner <a href="http://meliharvey.com/">Meli Harvey</a> has taken <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Sidewalk/vfx9-tbb6">New York City’s official dataset of sidewalks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/meliharvey/sidewalkwidths-nyc">dissected its geometries</a> to <a href="http://www.sidewalkwidths.nyc/">map the width of each segment of walkable pavement</a>.

<p><strong>Crowdsourced moral judgements.</strong> Data scientist <a href="https://www.elle-obrien.com/">Elle O’Brien</a> <a href="https://dvc.org/blog/a-public-reddit-dataset">recently described</a> how she built and cleaned a <a href="https://github.com/iterative/aita_dataset">dataset of the moral dilemmas</a> posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/">r/AmItheAsshole</a>, “a semi-structured online forum that’s the internet’s closest approximation of a judicial system.” For each of the 97,628 posts collected, the dataset includes the title, body, date, number of Reddit upvotes, and number of comments — plus the community’s verdict.
