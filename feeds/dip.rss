<p><strong>Per-pupil spending.</strong> The <a
href="https://edunomicslab.org/nerds/">National Education Resource
Database on Schools</a> (“<em>NERD$</em>”) describes itself as the
“first-ever national dataset of public K-12 spending by school.” Its
researchers, based at Georgetown University, aggregate and standardize
the <a

disclosures</a> that the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/ESSA/">Every
Student Succeeds Act</a> requires states to publish. You can explore and
download the data they’ve processed for fiscal year 2019, including
spending totals, enrollment counts, and normalized figures that
facilitate cross-state comparisons. For 2020–22, you can access “the raw
files we obtain from states while our team conducts validation checks
and norms the data.” <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

<p><strong>Travelers’ coronavirus variants.</strong> In the past year,
the CDC’s <a
href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-genomic-surveillance">Traveler-Based
Genomic Surveillance program</a> has collected 60,000+ voluntary nasal
swabs from people disembarking international flights at four major US
airports. The agency uses the samples as an “early warning system” to
detect emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and <a
href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#traveler-genomic-surveillance">publishes
weekly metrics</a> that include participation counts, positivity rates
(per pooled sample), and variant distributions. <strong>Read

<p><strong>Indonesia earthquake intensities.</strong> <a

database compiled by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1785/0120220047">Stacey
S. Martin et al.</a>, uses historical documents to catalog 7,300+
“macroseismic effects” of 1,200 earthquakes near Indonesia during a
four-century span, from 1546 to 1950. It provides summaries of the local
reports and categorizes the effects according to the <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>More roadkill.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01599-6">Florian Heigl
et al.</a> have compiled a <a

15,000+ reports of vertebrate roadkill from 2014 to 2020, submitted by
900+ people <a href="https://roadkill.at/en">through a phone app</a>.
The datasets differ in identification confidence, but both provide
locations, dates, and taxonomic classifications. Although the records
span 40+ countries, the majority come from Austria, where the project is

<p> </p>
<p><em>👋 Do you want to know more about what fellow DIP subscribers are
doing? Do you want to announce DIP-related projects to others? Do you
dislike these ideas? I’ve created a <a
href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemUwOBIccDOvJEhZx57laugJfL71fllf1__mLC91g2ScfPpg/viewform">short
survey</a> and would be grateful if you could <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Presidential pardons.</strong> The US Department of Justice’s
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/pardon">Office of the Pardon
Attorney</a> reviews all federal clemency requests and advises the
president on such matters. The office provides a <a
href="https://www.justice.gov/pardon/search-clemency-case-status-since-1989">search
tool and spreadsheet</a> with the names, case statuses, and decision
dates for all 76,000+ pardon and commutation requests since 1989. It
also publishes a <a
href="https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemency-recipients">series of
tables</a>, with varying structure, listing the people who received
clemency from each president since Richard Nixon. Those tables
additionally include recipients who did not submit formal requests and,
for more recent presidents, details about the recipients’ offenses and
sentences. <a
href="https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemency-statistics">Another
page</a> contains clemency statistics for each year and president since
William McKinley.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Radioactive waste.</strong> Through its <a
href="https://www.eia.gov/Survey/#gc-859">Nuclear Fuel Data Survey</a>,
the US Energy Information Administration “collects data on spent nuclear
fuel from all utilities that operate commercial nuclear reactors and
from all others that possess irradiated fuel from commercial nuclear
reactors.” The agency’s <a
href="https://www.eia.gov/nuclear/spent_fuel/">latest release</a>, <a
href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47796">published
last year</a> with data through 2017, includes several basic tables. One
tallies the <a
href="https://www.eia.gov/nuclear/spent_fuel/ussnftab3.php">annual
amount of nuclear fuel discharged and stored at commercial sites</a>
since 1968, measured by <a
href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/fuel-assembly-fuel-bundle-fuel-element.html">assembly</a>
count and metric tons of uranium. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

Lomax</a>, a musicologist who collected many of the recordings. The <a

<a href="https://www.grid-database.org/team">international team of
economists</a> using longitudinal administrative data and “designed from
ground up with a focus on comparability across countries.” The project’s

stats ranging from the widely-understood (e.g., share of income going to
the top 1%) to the more specialized (e.g., <a

of various income-change distributions). It currently covers 13
countries (although access to the UK’s data is listed as “coming soon”),
with timespans that typically stretch from the 1980s or 1990s to the
mid/late-2010s.</p>

<p><strong>Nuclear stockpiles.</strong> As of early 2022, a total of
nine countries possessed approximately 12,700 nuclear warheads,
according to <a
href="https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/">estimates
from the Federation of American Scientists</a>. Although “the exact
number of nuclear weapons in each country’s possession is a closely held
national secret,” the researchers say that “publicly available
information, careful analysis of historical records, and occasional
leaks” make the estimates possible, albeit “with significant
uncertainty.” The report includes each country’s current warhead count
and subtotals by status, as well as annual totals for each country since
1945. <strong>As seen in</strong>: <a

revamped</a> its method of pricing US flood insurance, aiming for “rates
that are actuarily sound, equitable, easier to understand and better
reflect a property’s flood risk.” A <a

of datasets and dashboards</a> from the agency summarize the expected
changes in premiums, which began taking effect last year. They count the
number of policies for which monthly payments were projected to
increase/decrease by a given amount, bucketed into ten-dollar
increments, for each state, county, and ZIP code. <strong>As seen

<p><strong>Work-related injury counts.</strong> The US Occupational
Safety and Health Administration <a
href="https://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping">requires many</a> (<a
href="https://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/presentations/exempttable">but
not all</a>) businesses to <a
href="https://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/forms">track employees’
work-related injuries and illnesses</a>. Larger companies and those in
high-risk industries must <a
href="https://www.osha.gov/injuryreporting/">electronically submit
annual counts</a> to the agency. Thanks to freedom-of-information
lawsuits by <a

to publish <a
href="https://www.osha.gov/Establishment-Specific-Injury-and-Illness-Data">business-level
data from those electronic submissions</a> in 2020. The records, which
go back to 2016, include each business’s name, location, industry,
employee count, and employee hours worked, plus their reported number of
deaths, injuries, skin disorders, respiratory conditions, poisonings,
hearing loss, and other illnesses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>US hydrography.</strong> The <a

Hydrography Dataset</a>, maintained by the US Geological Survey,
“represents the water drainage network of the United States with

Acosta et al.</a>’s <a href="https://www.rebelleaders.org/">Rebel
Organization Leaders Database</a> “provides a wide range of biographical
information on all top rebel, insurgent, and terrorist leaders who were

name, gender, education, religion, languages spoken, number of children,
years in role, country fought against, cause of death, and <a

covers 425 individuals fighting against 80+ countries; the project also
features <a

documentation</a> places each format into one of 16 categories, such as
“digital audio,” “spreadsheets,” “navigational charts,” and “software
and code.” In August, the agency added <a

examining the “chainness” of 700,000+ US restaurants. Starting with
records provided by <a href="https://leadsdeposit.com/">a marketing-data
company</a>, the researchers standardized the restaurants’ names,
counted their frequencies, and classified them as chains (those with
more than five outlets) or not. The dataset also lists each restaurant’s
cuisine and location. <strong>As seen in</strong>: <a

matter 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller</a>.) The researchers then
used that model to generate <a

<p><strong>Federal audits.</strong> Nonprofits, state/local governments,

a year are <a href="https://facweb.census.gov/Resources.aspx">required
to undergo</a> a <a

<p><strong>A decade of tasks.</strong> Between April 2009 and February
2019, software engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/reborg">Renzo
Borgatti</a> set 17,000+ daily tasks for himself. He completed slightly
less than half of them. He labeled them with tags such as “@meeting”,
“@talk”, and “@clojure”. He estimated how many “<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoros</a>”
each would take, and how many they really did. We know this because
Borgatti allowed <a href="https://shape-of-code.com/">Derek M. Jones</a>

<p><strong>FDA inspections.</strong> The US Food and Drug
Administration’s <a

dashboard</a> lists 264,000+ assessments of facilities (primarily those
manufacturing food, drugs, and other FDA-regulated products) and
227,000+ problems the inspectors found. The fields include the facility
owner, location, product type, inspection completion date, and outcomes.
The records, which go back to fiscal year 2009, can be bulk-downloaded
from the dashboard and queried via <a
href="https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/api/index.htm">an API</a>. They
come with certain caveats; they exclude, for instance, “inspections
waiting for a final enforcement action” and those conducted by state
(rather than federal) inspectors. <strong>Related</strong>: <a
