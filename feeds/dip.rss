<p><em>👋 Data Is Plural isn’t officially on Twitter. But if you want a smörgåsbord of past datasets in your feed, you can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/DataispluralBot">@DataIsPluralBot</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/OscarBaruffa/status/1487830101664407552">recently created</a> by DIP subscriber <a href="https://twitter.com/OscarBaruffa">Oscar Baruffa</a>.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Abortion facility distances.</strong> <a href="https://cmyers.middcreate.net/">Caitlin Knowles Myers</a>, an economist with a <a href="https://cmyers.middcreate.net/scholarship/">focus on reproductive policy</a>, has <a href="https://osf.io/8dg7r/">compiled a dataset</a> that calculates — for every county in the contiguous US, every month between January 2009 and June 2021 — the distance you would have to travel to the nearest abortion facility. Researchers can also <a href="https://osf.io/tj4ud/">request access to Myers’s underlying database of the facilities themselves</a>. As described in her working paper, “<a href="https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/14556">Measuring the Burden: The Effect of Travel Distance on Abortions and Births</a>,” Myers gathered the information from a range of sources, including state licensing databases, facility websites, and Planned Parenthood directories. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.axios.com/distance-abortion-roe-supreme-court-texas-17ae0d8c-7882-408c-b6f9-bf6ece0f22a2.html">Abortions could require 200-mile trips if Roe is overturned</a>” (Axios).

<p><strong>Chinese technology companies abroad.</strong> <a href="https://chinatechmap.aspi.org.au/">Mapping China’s Tech Giants</a>, a project relaunched by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Strategic_Policy_Institute">Australian Strategic Policy Institute</a> last year, examines the overseas expansion of 27 major Chinese technology companies, from Alibaba to ZTE. The <a href="https://chinatechmap.aspi.org.au/#/data/">project’s dataset</a> includes 3,900+ entries, each describing and locating an operation or connection abroad. They’re grouped into a couple dozen categories, such as commercial partnerships, overseas offices, data centers, 5G relationships, training, and donations.

<p><strong>House committee witnesses.</strong> Political scientists <a href="https://www.rmc.edu/departments/political-science/faculty/lauren-bell">Lauren C. Bell</a> and <a href="https://jdrackey.com/">J.D. Rackey</a> have compiled a <a href="https://www.rmc.edu/departments/political-science/faculty/lauren-bell/dataset-information">spreadsheet of 435,000+ people testifying</a> before the US House of Representatives from 1971 to 2016. They began with a text file scraped from <a href="https://about.proquest.com/en/products-services/ProQuest-Congressional-Hearings-Digital-Collection/">a ProQuest database</a>, provided by the authors of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230104">a dataset that focused on social scientists’ testimony</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-12-23-edition/">DIP 2020.12.23</a>). Then, they determined each witness’s first and last name; type of organization; the committee, date, title, and summary of the relevant hearing; and more.

It’s officially available as <a href="https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1900/volume-1/volume-1-p13.pdf">a low-resolution PDF</a>. Reporters at <a href="https://stacker.com/">Stacker</a>, however, recently <a href="https://github.com/stacker-media/data/tree/main/1900-census-immigrant-state">transcribed it</a> into <a href="https://github.com/stacker-media/data/blob/main/1900-census-immigrant-state/1900-census-immigrant-pop-state.csv">a CSV file</a> for easier use.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>More political emails.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/derekwillis">Derek Willis</a>, a <a href="https://merrill.umd.edu/directory/derek-willis">journalism lecturer</a> with an expertise in political data, <a href="https://createsend.com/t/t-97F63A7D578A8F0B2540EF23F30FEDED">has published</a> a searchable, downloadable <a href="https://political-emails.herokuapp.com/">database of 100,000+ email messages</a> received in recent years by an address he created for this purpose, and “which I routinely plug into forms I find on candidate and committee sites.” The database, which Willis <a href="https://twitter.com/derekwillis/status/1480657382703312901">plans to update weekly</a>, lists each message’s timestamp, sender, subject line, and body. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://electionemails2020.org/">The Princeton Corpus of Political Emails</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-06-23-edition/">DIP 2021.06.23</a>), <a href="https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-wheres-my-email">the Markup’s collection of 5,000+ campaign emails</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-03-04-edition/">DIP 2020.03.04</a>, and <a href="https://www.dcinbox.com/">DCInbox’s congressional e-newsletter collection</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-03-03-edition/">DIP 2021.03.03</a>).

<p><strong>Foreign commerce interventions.</strong> The <a href="https://www.globaltradealert.org/">Global Trade Alert</a>, <a href="https://www.globaltradealert.org/about">launched in 2009</a>, “provides timely information on state interventions taken since November 2008 that are likely to affect foreign commerce,” such as new subsidies, export quotas, import tariffs, or anti-dumping laws. Its <a href="https://www.globaltradealert.org/data_extraction">downloadable dataset</a> describes 33,000+ interventions, listing their types, implementing jurisdictions, affected jurisdictions, affected products, and more. The project, <a href="https://www.unisg.ch/en/wissen/newsroom/aktuell/rssnews/forschung-lehre/2020/november/stgallen-endowment-for-prosperity-through-trade-26november2020">affiliated with the University of St. Gallen</a>, has also started tracking <a href="https://www.globaltradealert.org/digital_policy">interventions that affect digital commerce</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Commuting zones.</strong> Decades ago, the USDA <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/">Economic Research Service</a> developed a methodology to group the nation’s counties into hundreds of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting_zone">commuting zones</a>,” based on the Census’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/commuting.html">journey to work</a> data. Those groupings are available <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commuting-zones-and-labor-market-areas/">from the agency</a> (for 1980, 1990, and 2000), and <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/psucz/">from researchers at Penn State</a> (for those years plus 2010). More recently, Facebook/Meta <a href="https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/commuting-zones">has developed</a> its <a href="https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/docs/methodology-commuting-zones">own methodology</a> for estimating commuting zones, using location data collected from its users. The project’s <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/commuting-zones">public dataset</a> spans the world and specifies the zones not as sets of counties but as detailed, custom boundaries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tech support scams.</strong> From 2018 to 2021, the now-shuttered <a href="https://github.com/choozn/PopupDB-Data/">PopupDB Project</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210307114123/https://popupdb.org/">collected</a> information about <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-tech-support-scams">tech support scams</a> and their deceptive browser popups. Its maintainers have since released two final downloads: a “<a href="https://github.com/choozn/PopupDB-Data/tree/main/databases">light</a>” dataset that lists the URLs and web hosts of 11,000+ such popups, and a “<a href="https://popupdb.org/downloads">full</a>” database that includes screenshots and source code.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Slaveholders in Congress, pension plans, journal editors, radio on the internet, and chocolate bar reviews.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>👋 Some updates: After nearly eight (very fulfilling) years as BuzzFeed News’ data editor, I’m shifting roles there — I’ll be working part-time (for now) on a new initiative that I’m quite excited about. More details on that soonish. In the meantime, two related developments: ✨ <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/buzzfeed/jobs/3758781?gh_jid=3758781">we’re hiring a new data editor</a> ✨ (ask me about it!) and I’ve added a ✨ <a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/jobs">job board</a> ✨ to Data Is Plural (see below).</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Slaveholders in Congress.</strong> At least “1,715 members of Congress were enslavers at some point in their adult lives,” according to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/congress-slaveowners-names-list/">Washington Post investigation published Monday</a>. Reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/juliezweil">Julie Zauzmer Weil</a> began her research with a list of <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators">every person who ever served in the House or Senate</a>, filtered it to those born before 1840, and then consulted <a href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/">their biographies</a>, Census records, and other historical documents. The Post’s <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-congress-slaveowners/">public dataset</a>, the first of its kind, lists the congressmen from that era, their dates of birth, positions held in Congress, states served, dates served, and whether the Post determined they were slaveholders. For 677 of the congressmen, the Post “couldn’t reach a conclusion” and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/submit-congress-enslaved-database/">is seeking assistance from readers</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pension plans.</strong> <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/">Public Plans Data</a>, a <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/about/our-research">collaboration</a> led by Boston College professor <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/about/bios/munnell/">Alicia H. Munnell</a>, gathers extensive information about the retirement plans that state and local governments offer their employees, drawn from <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/resources/download-avs-cafrs/">those plans’ annual financial reports</a>. The project maintains a <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/public-plans-database/download-full-data-set/">range of datasets</a>, including two decades of participation and financial figures for 200+ plans that account for “95 percent of public pension membership and assets nationwide,” their investments, early payout options, and more. It also provides <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/resources/interactive-tools/">interactive tools</a> and <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/public-plans-database/api/">an API</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Journal editors.</strong> For his <a href="https://openeditors.ooir.org/">Open Editors</a> project, <a href="https://twitter.com/andrepacher">Andreas Nishikawa-Pacher</a> scrapes the websites of scholarly journals, extracting the names, affiliations, and roles of their listed editors and board members.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Civil asset forfeiture.</strong> “Most states and the federal government have laws allowing police and prosecutors to seize and permanently keep Americans’ cash, cars, homes and other property suspected of being involved in a crime — without regard to the owners’ guilt or innocence,” the nonprofit law firm <a href="https://ij.org/about-us/">Institute for Justice</a> writes in its <a href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/">third edition of <em>Policing for Profit</em></a>, published in 2020. The report gathers and analyzes <a href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/policing-for-profit-data/">datasets on property seized in dozens of states</a> through this practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States">civil asset forfeiture</a>, and on the spending of forfeiture funds. It also examines seizures from the federal <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jmd/major-information-systems-consolidated-asset-tracking-system">Consolidated Asset Tracking System</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/afp/freedom-information-act">detailed public extracts</a> of which the Department of Justice updates quarterly. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://thewhyaxis.substack.com/p/cops-still-take-more-stuff-from-people">Cops still take more stuff from people than burglars do</a>” (The Why Axis, 2021), and “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2014/09/06/stop-and-seize/">Stop and Seize</a>” (Washington Post, 2014).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Joint military exercises.</strong> Jordan Bernhardt’s <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HXQFHU">Joint Military Exercises Dataset</a> describes 5,000+ such operations undertaken between 1977 and 2016, drawn from historical news reports. The dataset lists each exercise’s name, location, when it began and ended, the countries that participated, activities involved, and more. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.brandonkinne.com/">Brandon J. Kinne</a>’s <a href="https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/defense-cooperation-agreement-dataset">Defense Cooperation Agreement Dataset</a>, a “comprehensive, human-coded dataset” covering bilateral defense treaties between 1980 and 2010.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Medical drug names.</strong> To build their <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9nmgzttxhm/1">International Drug Dictionary</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921009768">Mohammad A. Khaleel et al.</a> collected trade names and ingredient names “from open access websites belonging to official drug regulatory agencies, official healthcare systems, or recognized scientific bodies from 44 countries around the world,” among other sources. Each of the 450,000+ entries maps a name to standardized ingredient information from the National Library of Medicine’s <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html">RxNorm</a> database.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Foundation shades.</strong> For “<a href="https://pudding.cool/2021/03/foundation-names/">The Naked Truth</a>,” a Pudding article published last year with <a href="https://ofunneamaka.com/about-ofunneamaka/">Ofunne Amaka</a>, <a href="https://amber.rbind.io/">Amber Thomas</a> scraped <a href="https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/foundation-names">information about 6,800+ foundation shades</a> from the websites of two major cosmetics retailers.

<p><strong>Honey bees.</strong> Since the 1980s, the US Department of Agriculture has <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Bee_and_Honey/">conducted</a> an annual <a href="https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/hd76s004z?locale=en">Bee and Honey Inquiry Survey</a>, which generates estimates of “the number of colonies producing honey, yield per colony, honey production, average price, price by color class and value as well as honey stocks at the state and national levels.” Since 2016, it has also published <a href="https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/rn301137d?locale=en">annual reports that examine the gain and loss of colonies</a>, including losses due to <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/oc/br/ccd/index/">colony collapse disorder</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Local mortality and the 1918 pandemic.</strong> <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zf6wy/">Martin Eiermann, Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, et al.</a> have conducted an analysis of deaths before, during, and after the 1918 influenza pandemic, drawing on “data from multiple sources, including digitized mortality records for 70 U.S. cities, linked census records that establish urban residency status across multiple censuses” and newspaper accounts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-pharmaceutical_intervention_(epidemiology)">non-pharmaceutical interventions</a>. The team’s <a href="https://osf.io/njghd/">published files</a> includes a dataset that, for each city-and-year, lists the mortality rate overall, for white vs. non-white residents, and due to flu/pneumonia; a range of demographic variables; the timing of certain interventions; and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Religious congregations.</strong> The <a href="https://www.thearda.com/">Association of Religion Data Archives</a>, founded in 1997, “strives to democratize access to the best data on religion.” Among <a href="https://www.thearda.com/Archive/browse.asp">its resources</a> are <a href="https://www.thearda.com/Archive/NCS.asp">four waves of the National Congregations Study</a>, a <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/ncsweb/">Duke University–based survey</a> that <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/ncsweb/methodology/">asks US religious establishments</a> about their denominational affiliation, buildings of worship, congregants, staffing, educational offerings, and more.

<p><strong>Faster-turnaround mortality data.</strong> Last week, the CDC began publishing <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html">provisional US mortality statistics for 2018 to the near-present</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Citizenship laws.</strong> The <a href="https://globalcit.eu/">Global Citizenship Observatory</a>’s new <a href="https://globalcit.eu/databases/globalcit-citizenship-law-dataset/">Citizenship Law Dataset</a> “outlines, in a systematic way, 28 ways in which citizenship can be acquired and 15 ways in which citizenship can be lost.” <a href="https://twitter.com/GlobalCIT_EUI/status/1466362913019596803">Launched last week</a> and <a href="https://globalcit.eu/a-new-globalcit-citizenship-law-dataset-what-why-and-how/">building on the observatory’s previous work</a>, it covers the laws in effect in 190 countries in January 2020. For each mode of acquisition or loss in each jurisdiction, the dataset points to the legal citations, specifies the type of procedure (discretionary, automatic, etc.), and describes the relevant conditions (for instance, wedlock requirements for citizenship-by-descent). <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://macimide.maastrichtuniversity.nl/dual-cit-database/">Dual citizenship policies</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-01-09-edition/">DIP 2019.01.09</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Overturned Supreme Court decisions.</strong> The Library of Congress’s <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/">Constitution Annotated</a> project is a “comprehensive, government-sanctioned record of the interpretations of the Constitution,” intended for a wide audience and <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/about/constitution-annotated/">in publication for more than 100 years</a>. Its resources include a table of <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/decisions-overruled/">Supreme Court Decisions overruled by subsequent decisions</a>, with the names and years of the initial and overruling cases, and another of <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/unconstitutional-laws/">laws held unconstitutional</a>. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/appx-1/ALDE_00000679/">The methodologies for both tables</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://qz.com/2098152/how-often-are-supreme-court-decisions-overturned/">How often are Supreme Court decisions overturned?</a>” (Quartz).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Birds at the feeder.</strong> <a href="https://feederwatch.org/">Project FeederWatch</a> is a “November-April survey of birds that visit backyards, nature centers, community areas, and other locales in North America.” Tens of thousands of <a href="https://feederwatch.org/pfw/participants">volunteers</a> <a href="https://feederwatch.org/about/detailed-instructions/">record</a> the number and species of birds at each feeder, plus information about the surrounding environment. The results can be <a href="https://feederwatch.org/explore/">explored online</a> and <a href="https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/">downloaded in bulk</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/11/28/bird-feeder-pecking-order/">Which birds are the biggest jerks at the feeder?</a>” (Washington Post), which uses additional behavioral data <a href="https://feederwatch.org/about/detailed-instructions/#record-behavior-interactions">collected</a> by the volunteers; and a <a href="https://twitter.com/EliotITMiller/status/1465126217133219841">related Twitter thread</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pandemic-era alcohol policies.</strong> The US <a href="https://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov/about-apis">Alcohol Policy Information System</a> has <a href="https://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov/resource/covid-19/98">categorized the alcohol-related regulations</a> that each state (and DC) has enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how they’ve changed over time. The dataset covers January 2020 to mid-September 2021; it examines restrictions on bar and restaurant capacity, serving alcohol without food, alcohol delivery, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A map of our moon.</strong> A USGS <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/astrogeology-science-center/science/mrctr-gis-lab?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects">astrogeology lab</a> has built a <a href="https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Moon/Geology/Unified_Geologic_Map_of_the_Moon_GIS_v2">1:5,000,000-scale map of Earth’s moon</a>, the “chief purpose” of which is “to summarize the current state of lunar geologic knowledge.” It marks thousands of geologic boundaries, plus “surface features” such as crater rims, “fissures, grabens, scarps, mare wrinkle ridges” and more.

<p><strong>Language from 100 million academic articles.</strong> <a href="https://archive.org/details/GeneralIndex">The General Index</a>, a new project from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Malamud">Carl Malamud</a>’s <a href="https://public.resource.org/">Public Resource</a>, contains detailed linguistic data derived from 107,233,728 academic journal articles. The index’s main table contains all one-to-five-word sequences found in each article, and their frequencies — more than 355 billion “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">n-grams</a>” in total. A second table identifies nearly 20 billion keywords <a href="https://pypi.org/project/yake/">auto-extracted</a> from the corpus, and a third table lists the authors, title, publication date, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOI</a> associated with each article. <strong>Read more</strong>: “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02142-1">The plan to mine the world’s research papers</a>” (Nature, July 2019) and “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02895-8">Giant, free index to world’s research papers released online</a>” (Nature, October 2021).

<p><strong>Personal income.</strong> The US Bureau of Economic Analysis <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/personal-income-county-and-metropolitan-area-2020">has released</a> its latest <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income-county-metro-and-other-areas">county-level estimates of personal income</a>, which now cover 1969–2020. The per-capita numbers are also available by <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/about.html">metropolitan statistical area</a>, as well as disaggregated by income “component” (wages/salaries, income from assets, etc.) and industry.

<p><strong>Banking-crisis interventions.</strong> Economists <a href="https://faculty.som.yale.edu/andrewmetrick/">Andrew Metrick</a> and <a href="https://www.pfschmelzing.me/">Paul Schmelzing</a> have <a href="https://som.yale.edu/faculty-research-centers/centers-initiatives/program-on-financial-stability/metrick-schmelzing-paper-and-database">compiled a database</a> of 800+ banking crises spanning the years 1257 to 2019, plus 1,800+ government attempts to mitigate them. For each crisis, the database provides the starting year, relevant country or region, a brief description, and more. It also describes the interventions, lists their dates, classifies them into 20 categories (asset guarantees, market liquidity assistance, etc.), and links them to sources and prior literature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Europe’s primary forests.</strong> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00988-7">Francesco Maria Sabatini et al.</a> have combined information from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00988-7/tables/4">dozens of sources</a> to develop “the most comprehensive dataset” of Europe’s “primary forests” — those “where the signs of human impacts, if any, are strongly blurred due to decades without forest management.” The <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/European_Primary_Forest_Database/13194095/2">dataset</a>, which includes 18,411 patches across 33 countries, describes their names, locations, level of “naturalness,” dominant tree species, and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2016123">EU-Forest</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-01-25-edition/">DIP 2017.01.25</a>).</p>
