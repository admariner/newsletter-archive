<p><strong>Human trafficking.</strong> The <a

privacy techniques</a> to represent “over 206,000 victims and survivors
of trafficking identified across 190 countries and territories from 2002
to 2022.” The approach, developed in partnership with Microsoft
Research, converts anonymized case records into “a new dataset in which
records do not correspond to actual individuals, but which preserves the
structure and statistics (i.e., utility) of the original data.” Each row
indicates a (synthetic) individual’s gender, age group, citizenship,
country of exploitation, duration of reported trafficking, traffickers’
means of control, types of exploitation, and the year the <a
href="https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/data-contributors">collaborative’s

<p><strong>EU infringements.</strong> The European Commission publishes
a <a

and downloadable database</a> of all its decisions regarding national
infringements of <a

regulations, decisions, and directives</a>. It currently contains
58,000+ decisions in 24,000+ cases, going back to the late 1980s. (To
download the full database, conduct a blank search and then click the
“Export to Excel” link.) Each entry lists a decision type and date, case
identifier, country, policy area, and more. Recent examples include the
Commission’s decisions to refer Ireland to court for <a

<p><strong>Global military spending.</strong> How much money has each
country spent, each year, on its military? Different datasets have
different answers, cover different timeframes, and use different
methodologies. <a href="https://osf.io/pkxt8">Miriam Barnum et al.</a>’s
<a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DHMZOW">Global
Military Spending Dataset</a> attempts to bring them together. By
uniting “76 variables from 9 dataset collection projects,” the authors
write, “we provide the most comprehensive and complete set of published
datasets on military spending ever assembled.” Each of the variables
represents one source/methodology, and each observation is a
country-year. “Disagreement on the actual expenditure value for a given
country-year is common, even between datasets produced by the same
project,” they find. <strong>Previously</strong>: The Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute’s <a

<p><strong>Fatal police pursuits.</strong> Reporters at the San
Francisco Chronicle have compiled a <a
href="https://github.com/sfchronicle/police_pursuits">national
dataset</a> of 3,300+ deaths in police car chases in 2017–2022. <a
href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/us-world/article/police-chases-methodology-18685158.php">To
build it</a>, they used information from the federal government’s <a

Analysis Reporting System</a> (<a

public records requests. For each death, the dataset indicates the
person’s name, age, gender, race, and connection to the pursuit (driver,
passenger, bystander, officer). It also includes the incident’s date,
location, reason given for the pursuit, and main law enforcement agency
involved. <strong>Read more</strong>: “<a

the <a href="https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/2732/2">Private
International Cartels dataset</a>, “which the author believes to be the
largest collection of legal-economic information on contemporary
price-fixing cartels.” It spans three decades (1990–2019) and covers
1,500+ suspected or convicted cartels, including 1,100+ that “have been
deemed guilty of price fixing by one or more antitrust authority.” It
also links those cartels to tens of thousands of companies and to 2,000+
individuals indicted or punished for their involvement. The dataset’s
variables include information about cartel geography, industry, market
share, overcharges, penalties, and much more.</p>

<p><strong>Real-time airport disruptions.</strong> The Federal Aviation
Administration’s <a href="https://nasstatus.faa.gov/">National Airspace
System Status</a> dashboard provides real-time listings of delays and

<p><strong>Climate funding.</strong> To develop its “<a
href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2023/">Global
Landscape of Climate Finance 2023</a>” report, the <a
href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/">Climate Policy
Initiative</a> gathered data on grants, loans, equity and other types of
“primary financing in real economy sectors that reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and build climate resilience.” The report, published in
November, identified ~$1.3 trillion in such financing globally in
2021–2022. A spreadsheet provided alongside it indicates the estimated
amount by year, region, sector, focus on mitigation vs. adaptation, type
of financial instrument, funder sector (public vs. private), and funder
type (development bank, corporation, institutional investors, etc.).
Reports from <a
href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/resources/publications/">earlier
years</a> include downloadable data for <a
href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-a-decade-of-data/">2019–2020</a>
and <a

<p><strong>Federal laws since 1789.</strong> Political scientist and
“recovering lawyer” <a href="https://brianlibgober.com/">Brian
Libgober</a> has compiled a “<a
href="https://osf.io/qa289">comprehensive dataset of U.S. federal
laws</a>,” covering 49,000+ legislative enactments from 1789 to 2022.
Such a dataset has been elusive, <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02758-z">Libgober
notes</a>, in part “because such laws have been enacted over hundreds of
years, resulting in a complicated patchwork of documents published in
numerous and inconsistent formats.” His solution combines three key
sources: “the oldest meta data for the U.S. <em>Statutes at Large</em>
disseminated via HeinOnline, similar and more recent meta data through
the Governmental Printing Office, and finally the last six years of
law-making as described by the National Archives’ website.” The dataset
lists each law’s title, legislative session, date of passage,
source/citation identifiers, and more.</p>

<p><strong>TSA complaint counts.</strong> The Transportation Security
Administration <a
href="https://www.tsa.gov/foia/readingroom">publishes</a> semi-regular
reports on the complaints it receives, aggregated by month, airport,
category, and subcategory. Unfortunately, the agency only publishes
those reports as PDFs, rather than structured data files. So volunteers
and I at the <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data
Liberation Project</a> have built a <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/tsa-complaint-counts">data
pipeline</a> to convert those PDFs <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/tsa-complaint-counts/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#data-guidance">into
tidy CSV files</a>, currently covering complaints to TSA at 440+
airports (and additional complaints not specifying any airport) from
January 2015 to January 2024. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Self-driving stats.</strong> Companies wanting to test or
deploy self-driving cars on California’s public roads must receive a
permit from the state DMV’s <a
href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/">Autonomous
Vehicles Program</a>. As part of the requirements, these companies must
“submit annual reports to share how often their vehicles disengaged from
autonomous mode during tests (whether because of technology failure or
situations requiring the test driver/operator to take manual control of
the vehicle to operate safely).” These <a
href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/disengagement-reports/">disengagement
reports</a> indicate each vehicle’s company, permit number, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number">VIN</a>,
monthly miles driven, and annual disengagements — including vehicles
with none. And for each disengagement, the reports list the vehicle,
date, disengagement initiator (vehicle, test driver, remote operator, or
passenger), type of location, and a brief summary. [h/t <a

from 160+ organizations</a>, coordinated through a <a

of 361 primary contests in Spain since 1991, “based on information
provided by political parties at the time of the event through their
websites, press releases, and journalistic reports.” It includes
primaries to determine candidates for regional, national, and EU
elections, as well as for party leadership. For each contest, it lists
the party, territory, year, type of post, number of competitors,
turnout, incumbent’s outcome, winner’s percentage, and more.</p>

to Grist</a>, which published a <a
href="https://grist.org/project/indigenous/land-grant-universities-indigenous-lands-fossil-fuels/">data-driven
investigation</a> on the topic last week. These lands — expropriated
from Indigenous nations and managed by state governments for profit —
“exist in 21 Western and Midwestern states, totaling more than 500
million surface and subsurface acres.” Grist’s inquiry focuses on those
benefiting <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-grant_university">land-grant

<p><strong>Household composition.</strong> <a

et al.</a>’s <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/8142652">CORESIDENCE
database</a> provides 146 indicators of household arrangements in 156
countries and ~4,000 regions, spanning the years 1964 to 2021. The
indicators range in specificity, from average household size to, e.g.,
the average number of non-relatives in 3-person households. They also
include gender breakdowns, such as the proportion of 5-person households
among female-headed households. The metrics are calculated using
“global-scale individual microdata from four main repositories and
national household surveys, encompassing over 150 million individual
records representing more than 98% of the world’s population.”</p>

<p><strong>Comics, deconstructed.</strong> The Tilburg University–based
<a href="https://www.visuallanguagelab.com/">Visual Language Lab</a>,
led by comics scholar <a

“all aspects of visual language, from the structure of individual
drawings, emoji, or cartoons, to how we make meaning out of sequences of
images like in comics.” The lab’s <a

href="https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/LWMZ7G">dataset</a>’s
sources include material from multiple continents, time periods, and
genres. The annotations examine “attentional framing structure and

<p><strong>Nursing home prices.</strong> Between December 2020 and March

South, US travel behavior, space X-rays, and amateur archaeological

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Local election results.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02792-x">Justin de
Benedictis-Kessner et al.</a> have compiled a <a
href="https://osf.io/mv5e6/">dataset</a> of 77,000+ (distinct)
candidates across 57,000+ US elections for mayor, city council, school
board, county executive, county legislature, sheriff, and prosecutor. It
is, they write, “the most comprehensive publicly-available source of
information on local elections across the entire country.” It includes
“most medium and large cities and counties” and spans 1989 to 2021. The
authors combined data from pre-existing databases, state election
websites, and newspaper archives. They also “worked with a team of
research assistants who coded results from thousands of local elections
based on city and county websites.” For each candidacy, the <a
href="https://osf.io/tbwzd">core table</a> indicates the election’s
jurisdiction, office, and timing, plus the candidate’s name, incumbency
status, party, estimated demographics, votes won, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mid-century anti-Black killings.</strong> The <a
href="https://crrjarchive.org/">Burnham-Nobles Archive</a> at the
Northeastern University School of Law is “dedicated to identifying,
classifying, and providing factual information and documentation about
anti-Black killings in the mid-century South.” The current version <a
href="https://crrjarchive.org/scope">focuses</a> on 11 southern states
during 1930–1954. Developed by political scientist <a
href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/melissa-nobles">Melissa Nobles</a>
and law professor <a
href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/burnham/">Margaret
Burnham</a>, the <a href="https://crrjarchive.org/archive">long-running
project</a> has gathered 12,000+ <a
href="https://crrjarchive.org/sources">news articles, death
certificates, federal agency records, and other sources</a>. It
documents 900+ incidents and 950+ victims, as well as alleged

<p><strong>US travel behavior.</strong> Fielded every five to eight
years since 1968, the Federal Highway Administration’s <a
href="https://nhts.ornl.gov/">National Household Travel Survey</a> “is
the authoritative source on the travel behavior of the American public.”
The questionnaire asks respondents to inventory all of their household’s
trips taken during a 24-hour period. The most recent survey, for 2022,
includes ~31,000 trips by ~17,000 people in ~8,000 households. It
indicates each trip’s duration, vehicle details, motivation, parking
costs, traveler demographics, and much more. The FHA provides <a
href="https://nhts.ornl.gov/downloads">downloads of the anonymized
data</a>, as well as <a href="https://nhts.ornl.gov/documentation">user
guides and technical notes</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

<p><strong>Space X-rays.</strong> <a
href="https://erosita.mpe.mpg.de/">eROSITA</a> is a <a
href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/03/aa39313-20/aa39313-20.html">wide-field
X-ray telescope</a> “capable of delivering deep, sharp images over very
large areas of the sky,” helping researchers “to study the large-scale
structure of the universe.” The telescope launched into orbit in 2019 as
a collaboration between Russia and Germany, with data rights split
between the countries. In February 2022, following Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine, Germany’s Max Planck Institute <a
href="https://www.mpe.mpg.de/7856215/news20220303">suspended eROSITA’s
operations</a>. Data processing continued, however, and last week the
institute <a

href="https://erosita.mpe.mpg.de/dr1/index.html">first data release</a>.
It contains the first six months of results for the hemisphere assigned
to Germany, and is “the largest X-ray catalogue ever published.”</p>

<p><strong>Amateur archaeological finds.</strong> The British Museum’s
<a
href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/our-work/national/treasure-and-portable-antiquities-scheme">Portable
Antiquities Scheme</a> “records archaeological finds discovered by the
public,” assisted by a network of national and local partners. Its <a

people by chance, most through metal detecting.” The most common finds:

<p><strong>Groundwater levels.</strong> To assess global trends in
groundwater levels, <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06879-8">Scott Jasechko

annual groundwater levels “in all cases for which we have received
permission from a database manager to post data,” amounting to more than
4 million measurements (59% of the total). The published records also
include the boundaries of 1,600+ aquifer systems, “manually delineated
[…] using maps and descriptions from 1,236 local and regional studies.”

reduced-price equipment to foreign governments. The Department of
Defense <a

a spreadsheet of the program’s authorizations and transfers</a>, last
updated in mid–2020 and going back to 2010. Each of the 4,100+ entries
lists the foreign country, item description, transfer status, status
date, whether it was a sale or grant, quantities (requested, allocated,
accepted, rejected, delivered), “current” value, and acquisition value.
Items range in size and significance, from vinyl tape (55 rolls
authorized for transfer to Iraq in 2016) to <a

<p><strong>RSV.</strong> The US CDC’s <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net/index.html">Respiratory
Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network</a> collects data
on hospital admissions due to lab-confirmed <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html">RSV</a> at acute-care
facilities in 58 counties, across 12 states. The CDC uses the data to
estimate weekly hospitalization rates — overall as well as by age group,
race/ethnicity, and sex. Those rates, which go back to 2016–17 for
adults and 2018–19 for minors, are available via an <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net/dashboard.html">interactive
dashboard</a> and <a
href="https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-Rates-of-Laboratory-Confirmed-RSV-Hospitali/29hc-w46k/about_data">downloadable
dataset</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: The network is part of a <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/resp-net/dashboard.html">broader
system</a> that also monitors <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/influenza-hospitalization-surveillance.htm">influenza</a>
and <a

features weekly data tables and epidemiological summaries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Subnational economic output.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02323-8">Leonie Wenz et
al.</a>’s <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7573249">Database of
Sub-national Economic Output</a> (DOSE) provides “harmonised data on
reported economic output from 1,661 sub-national regions across 83
countries from 1960 to 2020.” Those regions include, for instance,
Turkey’s 81 provinces, Japan’s 47 prefectures, and Kenya’s 47 counties.
For each year, the dataset indicates the monetary value of the region’s
total economic output, and often also subtotals for the agricultural,
manufacturing, and services sectors. While previous projects have used
interpolation to estimate similar figures, DOSE avoids that approach,
instead <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02323-8/tables/1">assembling
its data</a> only from “statistical agencies, yearbooks and academic
literature.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Environmental treaties.</strong> <a
href="https://rmitchel.uoregon.edu/">Ronald B. Mitchell</a>’s <a
href="https://iea.uoregon.edu/">International Environmental Agreements
Database Project</a> tracks <a
href="https://iea.uoregon.edu/iea-project-contents">4,000+ such
arrangements</a>, <a
href="https://iea.uoregon.edu/international-environmental-agreements-ieas-defined">defined</a>
as “an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a
primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on
natural resources.” Examples include the <a
href="https://iea.uoregon.edu/treaty/198">Indus Water Treaty</a> (1960)
and <a href="https://iea.uoregon.edu/treaty/3197">Convention on Nuclear
Safety</a> (1994). The project’s <a
href="https://iea.uoregon.edu/ieadb-and-related-datasets">datasets</a>
characterize each agreement (e.g., its name, signature date, type,
subject) and 100,000+ “membership actions” by participating countries.
The project also tracks various “non-agreements,” such as memoranda of
understanding. [h/t <a

Morin et al.</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Chicago’s “menu money.”</strong> Chicago’s 50 wards can each
receive up to $1.5 million annually to spend on infrastructure projects
such as street lighting, sidewalk repair, art murals, and park
improvements. Each ward’s city council representative typically decides
how to spend this so-called “menu money,” although <a
href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/8/3/23819111/chicago-vote-tax-money-spent-wards-participatory-budgeting-democracy-solutions-project">some
let residents allocate a portion</a>. The city <a
href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/obm/provdrs/cap_improve/svcs/aldermanic-menu-program.html">publishes</a>
menu money spending reports, but <a
href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/obm/provdrs/cap_improve/svcs/cip-archive.html">only
as PDFs</a>. So data researcher <a
href="https://jakejeromesmith.wordpress.com/">Jake J. Smith</a> has <a
href="https://github.com/jakejsmith/ChicagoMenuMoney">programmatically
converted</a> twelve years of those PDFs (2012–2023) into a <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MZpUnD8bXceRw-P3fiTZtH7KtSunNaEYa-xpapWw1Ho/edit">spreadsheet
containing 28,000 line items</a>. Each entry <a
href="https://github.com/jakejsmith/ChicagoMenuMoney/blob/main/data-dictionary.md">indicates</a>
the year, ward, line item’s cost, category, program, and description
(often the location of the project).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Star Trek chairs.</strong> <a
href="https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/">Ex Astris Scientia</a>, <a
href="https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/misc/introduction.htm">run by
Bernd Schneider since 1998</a>, contains much of what you might expect
from a <em>Star Trek</em> fan site, such as <a

summaries</a>, <a
href="https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/index-starships.htm">starship
catalogs</a>, and an <a
href="https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/treknology.htm">extensive
encyclopedia</a>. But it also publishes some more esoteric inventories,
such as HTML tables of <a
href="https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/database/chairs-trek.htm">commercially
available chairs</a> and <a
href="https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/database/lighting-trek.htm">lamps</a>
that have appeared on screen. [h/t <a
