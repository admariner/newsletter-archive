    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Standardized electric-utility info, school vaccination rates, global empires, farming households, and pinball.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Electric utilities, standardized.</strong> “Electric utilities report a huge amount of information to the US government,” but “much of this data is not released in well documented, ready-to-use, machine readable formats.” That assessment comes from the <a href="https://catalyst.coop/pudl/">Public Utility Data Liberation</a> (PUDL) project, which aims to clean, standardize, and cross-link the electric utility information gathered by various agencies. Earlier this month, PUDL published <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3653159">its first data release</a>; it includes information originally collected through Energy Information Administration <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/">Form 860</a> (details about individual generators) and <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/">Form 923</a> (individual power plants), the Environmental Protection Agency’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/emc/emc-continuous-emission-monitoring-systems">Continuous Emissions Monitoring System</a> (hourly emissions), and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/docs-filing/forms/form-1/data.asp">Form 1</a> (price rates and financial audits). The code PUDL uses to download, extract, and standardize the raw data is also <a href="https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl">available online</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>School vaccination rates.</strong> Reporters at the Wall Street Journal collected <a href="https://github.com/WSJ/measles-data">data on school-specific vaccination rates</a> — both overall and also for the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine — from 32 US states’ health departments. In total, the WSJ’s dataset covers more than 46,000 schools, of which 42,000 have at least one vaccination rate available. Most states provided data for the 2018–19 school year; the rest did so for 2017–18.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4,500 years of empire.</strong> To help study “<a href="https://voxeu.org/article/imperial-roots-global-trade">the imperial roots of global trade</a>,” a trio of economists have built a <a href="https://www.wnvermeulen.com/empires/">dataset of 168 historical empires</a>. For each empire, the dataset lists the modern-day countries under rule (and during which years), plus whether the empire had a centralized administration, centralized religion, and/or monopoly on coin-minting. [h/t <a href="https://mailchi.mp/newsletter.jainfamilyinstitute.org/some-totality">Jain Family Institute</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Farm households.</strong> The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0388-8">Rural Household Multiple Indicator Survey</a> (RHoMIS) “collects information on 758 variables covering household demographics, farm area, crops grown and their production, livestock holdings” and more. In an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0388-8">academic article published this month</a>, researchers from the Nairobi-based <a href="https://www.ilri.org">International Livestock Research Institute</a> presented a <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/9M6EHS">dataset of responses collected from 13,310 farm households</a> in 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, and Asia between 2015 and early 2018.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pinball.</strong> The crowdsourced website <a href="https://pinballmap.com">pinballmap.com</a> provides data on more than 25,500 pinball machines at more than 7,400 locations in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Finland, and Japan. The <a href="https://pinballmap.com/api/v1/docs">website’s API</a> lets you access the underlying data, including the specific machines available at each location.</p>

    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Banking crises, Europe in translation, simulated hurricanes, arXiv metadata, and the greatest hip-hop tracks of all time.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Banking crises.</strong> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/laevenl/home">Luc Laeven</a> and <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/cv/AuthorCV.aspx?AuthID=179">Fabián Valencia</a> — economists at the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, respectively — have built and maintain a <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2018/09/14/Systemic-Banking-Crises-Revisited-46232">dataset of systemic banking crises</a>, like those that rippled across the globe in 2008. First published in 2008 and most recently updated in 2018, the dataset covers on 151 crises affecting 118 countries from 1970 to 2017. For each episode, the dataset provides the starting and ending dates, policy responses, output loss, fiscal cost, increase in public debt, and more. [h/t <a href="https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData/commit/5499561d2ff6b692ed59770b0f62e3fe98995bdc">Erik Gahner Larsen</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Europe in translation.</strong> <a href="https://iate.europa.eu/home">IATE</a> is the European Union’s official terminology database, containing translations for words and phrases such as “orange juice,” “climate change policy”, and “competence of the Member States.” (That’s <em>succo d’arancia</em> in Italian, <em>ilmastonmuutospolitiikka</em> in Finnish, and <em>tagállami hatáskör</em> in Hungarian.) Over the past 20+ years, the project has accumulated more than 970,000 entries, translated into nearly 8 million phrasings in 25 languages. You can search the entries online or <a href="https://iate.europa.eu/download-iate">download the entire dataset</a> as a single XML file.

<p><strong>Tropical cyclone simulations.</strong> A team of scientists have used historical hurricane and typhoon data to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0381-2">simulate</a> a <a href="https://data.4tu.nl/repository/uuid:82c1dc0d-5485-43d8-901a-ce7f26cda35d">10,000 plausible years of cyclone activity</a>. The dataset covers the world’s most active “basins” — the areas where cyclones form — and includes each simulated storm’s path, maximum wind speed, average pressure, and more. [h/t <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jcnathaz/status/1225676744625012736">Jose A Cañizares</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>arXiv metadata.</strong> Founded nearly 30 years ago, <a href="https://arxiv.org">arXiv</a> is an open-access repository of more than 1,600,000 scholarly articles — typically “preprints” of papers, uploaded by the authors before being peer-reviewed — in physics, math, computer science, statistics, economics, and several other fields. The website participates in <a href="https://www.openarchives.org">Open Archives Initiative</a>, providing <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/oa/index">metadata on uploaded articles</a> through the initiative’s protocol; it also <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/api/index">has an API</a>. Last summer, computer science student <a href="https://boramalper.org">Bora M. Alper</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/c39mmj/arxiv_complete_metadata_dump_20190618_internet/">collected</a> the metadata for all the site’s papers and <a href="https://archive.org/details/arXiv-metadata-dump-2019-06-18.tar.xz">published it as a single file</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Biggie data.</strong> What are the greatest hip-hop songs of all time? Last year, the BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-who-voted">posed that question</a> to more than 100 artists, producers, critics, and other experts, asking each to rank their top five tracks. (Notorious B.I.G.’s “Juicy” <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time">nabbed the highest rating</a>.) Software engineer <a href="https://simonjockers.de">Simon Jockers</a> has turned the responses into a <a href="https://github.com/sjockers/bbc-best-rapmusic">structured dataset</a> and <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/best-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-visualized/">visualized the results</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Credibly accused clergy.</strong> Reporters at ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/we-assembled-the-only-nationwide-database-of-priests-deemed-credibly-accused-of-abuse-heres-how">have assembled</a> the first-ever <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/credibly-accused/">nationwide database of US Catholic clergy “credibly accused” of sexual abuse</a>, based on nearly 180 official lists released by dioceses and religious orders. (The majority of the lists were published during the past year and a half, following a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury_investigation_of_Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_in_Pennsylvania">landmark grand jury report in Pennsylvania</a>.) The database contains more than 6,700 names so far, plus details available from some of the lists, including birth year, ordination year, assignments, and status.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Coronavirus cases.</strong> As the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak">Wuhan coronavirus outbreak</a> intensifies, a team at Johns Hopkins has been <a href="https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">mapping the number of confirmed cases</a>, deaths, and recoveries. The project <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/">aggregates data</a> from several sources, including the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/">WHO</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html">US CDC</a>, <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases">European CDC</a>, and <a href="https://ncov.dxy.cn/">DXY</a>, a website that reports case counts from China’s CDC and National Health Commission.

<p><strong>Baseball sign-stealing.</strong> “I’m an Astros fan. They cheated during the 2017 regular season — the evidence is clear. In an attempt to understand the scope of the cheating and the players involved, I decided to listen to every pitch from the Astros’ 2017 home games and log any banging noise I could detect.” That’s from <a href="https://twitter.com/adams_at">Tony Adams</a>, who <a href="http://signstealingscandal.com/about/">analyzed audio spectrograms</a> corresponding to more than 8,200 pitches. Last week, he published <a href="http://signstealingscandal.com/">a website documenting his findings</a>, including <a href="http://signstealingscandal.com/files/">a spreadsheet of the data</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="http://signstealingscandal.com/statistical-analysis/">Adams’s list of stories and analyses that have used the data</a>.

<p><strong>Hotel bookings.</strong> In 2018, a trio of researchers at the Instituto Universitário de Lisboa published a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191">dataset detailing nearly 120,000 (anonymized) bookings</a> at two (unnamed) hotels in Portugal between July 2015 and August 2017. The bookings, extracted from the hotels’ property management systems, are described in detail: the number of adults, children, and babies for the reservation; country of origin; customer, room, and deposit types; whether the guests were repeat visitors; the number of special requests made; and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Last (but not least) names.</strong> From the US Census Bureau, you can download a dataset of <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2010_surnames.html">all surnames that belonged to at least 100 people in 2010</a>, and <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2000_surnames.html">the same for 2000</a>.

<p><strong>How we spend our time.</strong> Ever year since 2003, the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/tus/home.htm">American Time Use Survey</a>, has been measuring how much time we spend sleeping, eating, and working; with friends, with family, and alone; and much more. Unlike <a href="https://www.timeuse.org/information/access-data">many other time use surveys</a>, the ATUS’s <a href="https://www.bls.gov/tus/data.htm">respondent-level datasets</a> are freely available to the general public. Other time use surveys with downloadable data include the <a href="https://dataverse.unc.edu/dataverse/rlms-hse">Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey</a> and a <a href="https://data.mcc.gov/evaluations/index.php/catalog/205/study-description">Kosovo time use survey</a> sponsored by the Millennium Challenge Corporation. <strong>Related</strong>: Through <a href="https://ipums.org">IPUMS</a>, you can build custom data extracts <a href="https://www.atusdata.org/atus/">of the ATUS</a>, <a href="https://www.ahtusdata.org/ahtus/">of historical US time survey data</a>, and <a href="https://www.mtusdata.org/mtus/">of the Multinational Time Use Study</a> (registration required). <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://flowingdata.com/2019/07/16/how-the-american-work-day-changed-in-15-years/">How the American Work Day Changed in 15 Years</a>” and “<a href="https://flowingdata.com/2019/03/06/women-men-timeuse/">A Day in the Life: Women and Men</a>,” two visualizations by <a href="https://twitter.com/flowingdata">Nathan Yau</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Missing migrants.</strong> The <a href="https://missingmigrants.iom.int/about">Missing Migrants Project</a> “tracks deaths of migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have gone missing along mixed migration routes worldwide.” Research for the project, an initiative of the <a href="https://www.iom.int">International Organization for Migration</a>, began after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Lampedusa_migrant_shipwreck">fatal Lampedusa shipwrecks</a> of October 2013. For each incident, the project’s <a href="https://missingmigrants.iom.int/downloads">datasets</a> specify the location, the number of people who died, the number who are missing, the number who survived, the sources of information, the source quality, and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/ondata/the-list">European migration deaths</a>, 1993 to May 2018 (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2018-07-18-edition">DIP 2018.07.18</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Global antitrust.</strong> The <a href="https://comparativecompetitionlaw.org">Comparative Competition Law project</a> classifies the legal provisions and enforcement of antitrust laws around the world, over time. The project is run by law professors <a href="https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/anu-bradford">Anu Bradford</a> and <a href="http://www.adamchilton.org">Adam Chilton</a>, and features several <a href="http://comparativecompetitionlaw.org/data/">datasets and detailed codebooks</a>.

<p><strong>Microorganisms.</strong> The <a href="https://microbe.directory/">Microbe Directory</a> is an attempt to profile more than 7,000 bacteria, viruses, archaea, and other microorganisms. The directory <a href="https://microbe.directory/developers">can be downloaded</a> <a href="https://github.com/microbe-directory/microbe-directory">in bulk</a> and describes the microbes’ optimal temperature, optimal pH, Gram stain, pathogenicity, antimicrobial resistance, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Geographic (re)naming proposals.</strong> When someone wants to officially name or rename a geographic feature of the United States — such as a mountain, creek, or island — they file a proposal with the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/board-on-geographic-names">US Board on Geographic Names</a>. Those proposals end up on the agency’s “<a href="https://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=geonames_web:review_lists:0:::::">Action List</a>,” the most recent year of which can be downloaded as a spreadsheet. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data">The Board’s database of every US geographic name</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2015-10-21-edition">DIP 2015.10.21</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Global water quality.</strong> The UN’s <a href="https://gemstat.org">GEMStat project</a> provides “scientifically-sound data” on freshwater quality around the world. The <a href="https://gemstat.org/data/data-portal/">data portal</a> lets visitors <a href="https://gemstat.bafg.de/applications/public.html?publicuser=PublicUser">explore</a> and <a href="https://gemstat.org/custom-data-request/">download</a> water-sample results from thousands of stations in more than 80 countries. The information available for each sample varies, but it can include chemical, biological, and physical properties. <strong>Note</strong>: Not all locations have been sampled recently, and data downloads are limited to 500 stations at a time and for noncommercial purposes only. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/32245">The Invisible Water Crisis</a>,” a World Bank report from last year that used the GEMStat data.

<p><strong>State legislator ideologies.</strong> Political scientists <a href="https://research.bshor.com">Boris Shor</a> and <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~nmccarty/">Nolan McCarty</a>’s have <a href="https://americanlegislatures.com/faq/">assigned ideology scores</a>, on a conservative-to-liberal scale, to every US lawmaker in all 50 state legislatures. The <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6QWX7Q">most recent update</a>, published May 2018, covers more than 22,000 legislators from 1993 through 2016. Shor and McCarty derived the numeric scores from a combination of legislative voting records and responses to Vote Smart’s “<a href="https://justfacts.votesmart.org/about/political-courage-test/">Political Courage Test</a>.”</p>

<p><strong>Copyright complaints.</strong> Google has received millions of requests from copyright holders to delist billions of URLs from its search results. The company’s <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com">transparency reports</a> include a section where you can <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/copyright/overview">explore and download data</a> about these requests. One of the datasets describes 8.5 million delisting requests, with their dates, copyright holders, numbers of URLs targeted, and links to more details in <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org">the Lumen archive</a>. Another contains every web domain targeted, while another lists the URLs for which Google says it took no action.

<p><strong>California university history.</strong> The <a href="https://uccliometric.org">UC ClioMetric History Project</a> is digitizing decades of administrative records from the University of California and other schools in the state (such as USC and Stanford). So far, they’ve uploaded data on more than <a href="https://uccliometric.org/students/">750,000 student enrollments</a>, <a href="https://uccliometric.org/faculty/">tens of thousands of faculty members</a>, and <a href="https://uccliometric.org/courses/">800,000 courses</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Emissions indicators.</strong> The <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org">Climate Action Tracker</a> is “an independent scientific analysis” that keeps tabs on 32 countries’ progress on tackling climate change. Through its <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/data-portal/">data portal</a>, you can explore the project’s dozens of indicators — such as emissions per capita and renewable energy capacity — and also download the data in bulk. The countries covered include “the biggest emitters and a representative sample of smaller emitters,” and account for “about 80% of global emissions and approximately 70% of global population.” [h/t <a href="https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData">Erik Gahner Larsen</a>]</p>

<p><strong>MENA public opinion.</strong> <a href="https://www.arabbarometer.org/about/">The Arab Barometer</a> has “been conducting high quality and reliable public opinion surveys in the Middle East and North Africa since 2006,” and bills itself as “the largest repository of publicly available data on the views of men and women in the MENA region.” You can <a href="https://www.arabbarometer.org/survey-data/data-downloads/">download raw survey data</a> or explore it through the Barometer’s <a href="https://www.arabbarometer.org/survey-data/data-analysis-tool/">online analysis tool</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Duterte’s drug war deaths.</strong> In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Drug_War">the Philippines’ drug war</a>, President Rodrigo Duterte has given police broad permission to kill suspected drug dealers. But an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/08/philippines-dead-rodrigo-duterte-drug-war/595978/">investigation by reporters at the Columbia Journalism School</a> earlier this year found that “large numbers of killings [...] have been excluded from official counts.” The reporters collected data from <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6133399-Data-Sources-June04.html">23 sources</a> on 2,320 killings by police and unidentified assailants between July 2016 and December 2017 in three municipalities. <a href="https://data.world/stabile-center/ph-drug-war">Their dataset</a> (free account required to download, <a href="https://github.com/HRDAG/PH-drug-related-killings/tree/master/import/input">alternate version here</a>) indicates the month, local police station, whether police recorded the death, and more. <strong>Related</strong>: Because so many deaths appear to have gone unreported, the journalists worked with the <a href="https://hrdag.org/">Human Rights Data Analysis Group</a> to <a href="https://github.com/HRDAG/PH-drug-related-killings">estimate</a> the total number of undocumented deaths.

<p><strong>Death row.</strong> “Forty-three years after the Supreme Court reversed course and reinstated the death penalty, reliable data on the individuals sent to death row is maddeningly difficult to obtain.” <a href="https://theintercept.com/series/the-condemned/">So reporters at The Intercept</a> “set out to compile a comprehensive dataset on everyone sentenced to die in active death penalty jurisdictions since 1976.” <a href="https://github.com/firstlookmedia/the-condemned-data">The resulting database</a> contains more than 7,300 entries; for each person, it contains demographics, sentencing information, whether the person is still on death row, whether they’ve been exonerated, and more. <strong>Previously:</strong> <a href="https://endofitsrope.com/using-the-database/">Death sentences</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2018-08-01-edition">DIP 2018.08.01</a>), <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/execution-database">executions</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-05-15-edition">DIP 2019.05.15</a>), and <a href="https://selectstarsql.com/frontmatter.html#dataset">last words</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-03-06-edition">DIP 2019.03.06</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Spelling fixes.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/mhagiwara/github-typo-corpus">GitHub Typo Corpus</a> contains structured data on misspellings, bad grammar, and the ways they've been corrected. To build the dataset, <a href="http://masatohagiwara.net/">Masato Hagiwara</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/masatomita/">Masato Mita</a> analyzed the “commits” — sets of changes to files, typically accompanied by short summaries — made to tens of thousands of projects on the code-sharing platform GitHub. With “more than 350k edits and 65M characters in more than 15 languages,” <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12893">the authors say</a> it's “the largest dataset of misspellings to date.” [h/t <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/e5hdxt/spelling_and_grammar_correction_corpus_from/">u/Loves_Portisheads</a>]</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Income inequality around the world, over time.</strong> Political scientist <a href="https://fsolt.org/">Frederick Solt</a>’s <a href="https://fsolt.org/swiid/">Standardized World Income Inequality Database</a> provides annual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficients</a> for 196 countries and territories. For many, the calculations go back to the 1960s. The database draws on <a href="https://fsolt.org/swiid/swiid_source/">hundreds of sources</a>, including international organizations, national statistical offices, and academic studies. In an <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mwnje/">accompanying paper</a>, Solt argues that the SWIID represents an improvement over other similar efforts, such as the United Nations University’s <a href="https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/wiid-world-income-inequality-database">World Income Inequality Database</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-06-01-edition">DIP 2016.06.01</a>).

<p><strong>Ambassadorial qualifications.</strong> The Foreign Service Act of 1980 requires US presidents to provide Congress a “report on the demonstrated competence” for each ambassadorial nominee. In 2014, the government began <a href="https://www.state.gov/resources-bureau-of-human-resources/">disclosing these records</a>, which had long been held secret. But the government’s policy applied only to new nominees. Law professor <a href="https://ryanscoville.com/about/">Ryan Scoville</a>, however, used the Freedom of Information Act to pry loose the rest — more than three decades of concise biographies — and, earlier this year, <a href="https://ryanscoville.com/2019/02/13/certificates-of-competency-for-nominees-to-be-chiefs-of-mission-1980-2014/">put them online</a>, accompanied by a dataset that describes the nominees’ qualifications and political contributions. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3333988">Unqualified Ambassadors</a>,” Scoville’s <em>Duke Law Journal</em> article on the topic, and <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/troubling-trends-ambassadorial-appointments-1980-present">his summary in <em>Lawfare</em></a>.

<p><strong>Samoa’s measles outbreak.</strong> The Samoan government has been <a href="https://twitter.com/samoagovt/status/1201637336515112960">tweeting updates</a> regarding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Samoa_measles_outbreak">the country’s measles crisis</a>. Epidemiologist <a href="https://bitsandbugs.io/chris-von-csefalvay/">Chris von Csefalvay</a> has been <a href="https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/samoa-measles-2019">converting those tweets into a simple dataset</a> that counts the number of cases and deaths (by age group) at the time of each tweet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Science PhD candidates.</strong> Last month, <em>Nature</em> released <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7">findings</a> and <a href="https://figshare.com/s/74a5ea79d76ad66a8af8">response data</a> from its fifth survey of science graduate students. The questionnaire covered demographics, motivations, ambitions, satisfaction, mental health, and other topics. More than 6,000 students participated, including 1,000+ each living in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03489-1"><em>Nature</em>’s editorial board calls for “urgent attention” to students’ mental health</a>.

<p><strong>British Isle bumps.</strong> <a href="http://www.hills-database.co.uk/index.html">The Database of British and Irish Hills</a> began 20 years ago and now catalogs more than 20,000 bits of bumpy terrain. The <a href="http://www.hills-database.co.uk/downloads.html">data files</a> include detailed coordinates, map references, and descriptive characteristics.
