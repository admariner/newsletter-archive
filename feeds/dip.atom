States. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/lmop/landfill-technical-data">One
table</a> provides each site’s name, location, owners, operators,
ownership type, year opened, year closed, size, waste capacity, latest
waste tonnage, methane-related metrics, and more. <a

<p><strong>Water availability.</strong> The US Geological Survey last

Water Availability Assessment</a>, “a pioneering scientific overview of
water availability that offers first-of-its-kind insights into the

States.” Alongside the <a

any individual’s “full VA claims file, which may contain hundreds of
pages of never-before-seen biographical and historical material about
the veteran, their military service, and their interactions with the
VA.” <strong>Note</strong>: The “database is <em>not</em> a
comprehensive database of all American veterans, but rather a partial
and incomplete index of veterans who were eligible for VA benefits or
whose heirs had some kind of contact with the VA regarding
benefits.”</p>

the underlying data</a> available to <a

The effort “currently includes results for more than 110,000 precincts,
or 73 percent of all votes, and will be updated as more data is
collected.” The dataset lists each precinct’s state, county FIPS code,
votes received by Kamala Harris, votes received by Donald Trump, and
total votes (including third parties and write-ins). It also provides
each precinct’s geographical boundaries, derived from a mix of official
sources and estimations. <strong>Previously</strong>: “<a

Survey</a> has been gathering <a
href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/pssdata.asp">data about private
elementary and secondary schools</a> every two years since the 1989–90
school year. It collects information on “religious orientation; level of
school; size of school; length of school year, length of school day;
total enrollment (K-12); number of high school graduates, whether a
school is single-sexed or coeducational and enrollment by sex; number of
teachers employed; program emphasis” and more. In the latest data,
covering the 2021–22 school year, “there were 29,727 private schools,
enrolling 4,731,303 students and employing 482,571 full-time teachers”.

<p><strong>Quits and layoffs.</strong> Minneapolis Fed–affiliated
economists <a
href="https://sites.google.com/site/kathrinellieroth">Kathrin
Ellieroth</a> and <a href="https://ammichau.github.io/">Amanda
Michaud</a> have <a
href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/institute-working-papers/quits-layoffs-and-labor-supply">constructed</a>
a <a href="https://sites.google.com/qlmonthly.com/home">new dataset on
monthly quits and layoffs</a>. Using <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/">Current Population Survey</a> (CPS)
microdata going back to 1978, the dataset estimates the proportions of
employees who, after quitting or being laid off, transition to
unemployment versus exiting the labor market. In a <a
href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2024/where-is-the-us-labor-market-heading-interpreting-the-mixed-signals">recent
article</a>, Ellieroth and Michaud note that “CPS data offer a
perspective not seen in the most-often-used series on quits and layoffs,
the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS),” featured in <a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-09-21-edition/">DIP
2022.09.21</a>. “Whereas the JOLTS tracks what happens to a
<em>job</em>, the CPS tracks what happens to <em>people</em>.” Analyzing
it, they found “that increases in unemployment are typically
<em>not</em> due to increases in layoffs; rather, they happen because
laid-off workers are less likely to quickly find a new job, more likely
to stay in the labor force, and thus more likely to join a growing pool
of unemployed people hunting for work.” [h/t <a

<p><strong>Food safety alerts.</strong> Data journalist <a

href="https://github.com/anesta95/food_safety_recalls">automated
pipeline</a> to collect and standardize <a
href="https://github.com/anesta95/food_safety_recalls?tab=readme-ov-file#data-details">data
on food safety recalls and alerts</a> from two US federal agencies — the
<a
href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts">FDA</a>
and the <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls">USDA</a>. For each
alert, the <a
href="https://github.com/anesta95/food_safety_recalls/blob/main/clean_data/food_safety_recalls.json">standardized
dataset</a> indicates the notice’s title, ID, URL, and time posted, as

recall reason, impacted states, risk level, and <a

<p><strong>Crop rotations.</strong> The Department of Agriculture’s <a
href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Crop-Sequence-Boundaries/">Crop
Sequence Boundaries</a> initiative algorithmically analyzes satellite
imagery to create “estimates of field boundaries, crop acreage, and crop
rotations across the contiguous United States.” The results are
available via an <a
href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Crop-Sequence-Boundaries/Viewer/index.php">interactive
map</a> and downloads for eight-year time frames. The <a
href="https://github.com/USDA-REE-NASS/crop-sequence-boundaries">underlying
code is open-source</a> and can be used to generate datasets for custom
time frames. <strong>Previously</strong>: The USDA’s <a

<p><strong>A long-running ultramarathon.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.comrades.com/">Comrades Marathon</a>, first run in
1921, <a href="https://www.comrades.com/about/comrades-museum">is
considered</a> “the oldest and largest ultramarathon in the world.” The
route stretches 80+ kilometers between Durban and Pietermaritzburg,
flipping annually between “up” and “down” directions. In 2019, <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/suugaku">Kyle Stratton</a> scraped the
official website to construct a <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suugaku/comrades-marathon-results">dataset
