    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Private prisons, detailed elevations, even more mortality data, web trackers, and hockey.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Private prisons.</strong> Political scientist <a href="https://www.annagunderson.com/home">Anna Gunderson</a> has <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/why-do-states-privatize-their-prisons-the-unintended-consequences-of-inmate-litigation/AF814E16A605CA894D558AE72BEF65C9">assembled</a> a <a href="https://www.annagunderson.com/data/private-prisons">longitudinal dataset of private prisons</a> at the federal, state, and local level through 2016. Using decades of financial reports by the two largest operators, plus those by two other companies one later acquired, Gunderson’s dataset identifies each facility’s name, location, primary customer, capacity, security level, contract information, and more. <strong>Related</strong>: Last week, President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/executive-order-reforming-our-incarceration-system-to-eliminate-the-use-of-privately-operated-criminal-detention-facilities/">signed an executive order</a> to phase out the federal use of such facilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Detailed elevations.</strong> Among <a href="https://opentopography.org/about">its goals</a>, <a href="https://opentopography.org/">OpenTopography</a> wants to “democratize online access to high-resolution (meter to sub-meter scale), Earth science-oriented, topography data acquired with lidar and other technologies.” The project hosts <a href="https://portal.opentopography.org/dataCatalog">hundreds of elevation datasets</a> from <a href="https://portal.opentopography.org/datasets">around the world</a>, available to visualize online and to download. <strong>Related</strong>: The US Geological Survey’s <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep/what-is-3dep">3D Elevation Program</a> aims “to provide the first-ever national baseline of consistent high-resolution topographic elevation data” by 2023, and already publishes <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep/data-tools">a range of subnational datasets</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Even more mortality data.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality">World Mortality Dataset</a> contains recent “all-cause mortality” counts for 79 countries, aggregated to weekly, monthly, or quarterly totals (depending on availability). Launched last week by researchers <a href="https://akarlinsky.github.io/">Ariel Karlinsky</a> and <a href="https://dkobak.github.io/">Dmitry Kobak</a>, the project draws on the <a href="https://www.mortality.org/">Human Mortality Database</a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Weekly_death_statistics&amp;stable">EuroStat</a>, and data <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/excess-deaths">collected by the New York Times</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-05-27-edition">DIP 2020.05.27</a>); and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250604v1">expands upon it</a> by gathering data from government websites and through direct inquiries. [h/t <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dror-guldin-903950a8/">Dror Guldin</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Web trackers.</strong> DuckDuckGo’s <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/">Tracker Radar</a> watches the web’s watchers. The regularly-updated <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-radar">dataset</a> currently covers 36,000+ of the most common third-party domains, and provides “detailed information about their tracking behavior, including prevalence, ownership, fingerprinting behavior, cookie behavior, privacy policy,” and more. <strong>As seen in</strong>: <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight">Blacklight</a>, The Markup’s “real-time website privacy inspector,” which <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/how-we-built-a-real-time-privacy-inspector">uses the dataset</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hockey.</strong> The National Hockey League <a href="https://www.kevinsidwar.com/iot/2017/7/1/the-undocumented-nhl-stats-api">has an undocumented API</a>. Technologist <a href="https://pure-defect.com/about/">Drew Hynes</a> is <a href="https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi">making sense of the dozens of endpoints</a>, which provide data on decades of player stats, game schedules, draft picks, and more.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tens of millions of flights.</strong> The <a href="https://opensky-network.org">OpenSky Network</a> crowdsources air traffic data, thanks to members who collect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast">radio signals that aircraft periodically broadcast</a>. The nonprofit organization has published a “<a href="https://opensky-network.org/community/blog/item/6-opensky-covid-19-flight-dataset">COVID-19 flight dataset</a>,” which contains <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4419082">metadata for the tens of millions of flights</a> those members observed in 2019 and 2020, with plans to update the dataset until the pandemic ends. It includes each flight’s call sign, aircraft model type, origin and destination airports, time first and last seen, and more.

Do they use Google Analytics? Earlier this month, <a href="https://ben.balter.com/2021/01/11/analysis-of-federal-dotgov-domains-pre-biden-edition/">Balter ran the scan again</a>, “to serve as a snapshot of the state of government technology ahead of the incoming Biden administration.” You can <a href="https://ben.balter.com/2021-analysis-of-federal-dotgov-domains/">browse and download the results</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Corporate risk-talk.</strong> The <a href="https://www.firmlevelrisk.com/">Firm-Level Risk</a> project uses “textual analysis of quarterly earnings conference calls held by more than 11,000 listed firms in 81 countries” to construct company-by-company “measures of exposure, risk, and sentiment.” The <a href="https://www.firmlevelrisk.com/download">dataset</a> goes back nearly two decades and includes sub-measures for various themes, such as tax policy, Brexit, and COVID-19.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Euro-polling.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/filipvanlaenen/eopaod">European Opinion Polls as Open Data</a> repository collects the results of party-preference polls in 34 countries. For each poll, it lists the polling firm and commissioners, when the fieldwork began and ended, its scope and sample size, and the topline numbers for each party. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://medium.com/grensesnittet/how-simple-things-quickly-become-complicated-in-software-development-9cf52233226d">Project maintainer Filip Van Laenen on “how simple things can turn out to be rather complicated.”</a> [h/t <a href="https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData/commit/c0f0764f9c5b8b429ba71d9ce773967e8c849325">Erik Gahner Larsen</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Electoral attitudes.</strong> The <a href="https://u.osu.edu/cnep/">Comparative National Elections Project</a> “is a partnership among scholars who have conducted election surveys on five continents,” with a focus on understanding the factors that shape voters’ decisions. The project’s <a href="https://u.osu.edu/cnep/surveys/surveys-through-2012/">publicly-available datasets</a> include 48 of the surveys, which use a combination of country-specific questions and <a href="https://u.osu.edu/cnep/common-core-questionnaire/">shared questionnaire</a> — asking about political news consumption, attitudes towards democracy, interpersonal communications, and other topics. <strong>Related</strong>: The <a href="https://cses.org/">Comparative Study of Electoral Systems</a>, a similar collaboration with “a special emphasis on voting and turnout.” [h/t <a href="https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData/commit/26ff4d1932024d71b29a1195597d5e5a64367cca">Erik Gahner Larsen</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Fishing activity.</strong> <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/">Global Fishing Watch</a> — initially organized as <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/about-us/">a collaboration</a> between conservationists and Google — uses satellite imagery, ship signals, and other sources “to visualise, track and share data about global fishing activity in near real-time and for free.” The project’s <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/">public datasets</a> (free registration required) examine various aspects of the industry, including the <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/fishing-effort/">geography of “fishing effort”</a> (2012–16) and <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/transshipment-success/report-first-global-view-transshipment-sea/">transshipment between vessels</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-brexit-eu-fisheries/">Why the U.K. and EU Are Fighting Over Fish</a>” (Bloomberg).

<p><strong>Bundestag writings.</strong> Political scientists <a href="https://corinna-kroeber.jimdofree.com/">Corinna Kroeber</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tremsch">Tobias Remschel</a> have <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/government-and-opposition/article/every-single-word-a-new-data-set-including-all-parliamentary-materials-published-in-germany/34D424C406687F7446C6F32980A4FE84">compiled</a> a <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/7EJ1KI">dataset</a> of “all written communication published by the German Bundestag between 1949 and 2017,” unifying <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/services/opendata">datasets released by Germany’s parliament</a> “in a manner easily accessible to researchers applying text analysis.” For each of the 131,835 reports, requests, bills, and other documents, the dataset provides the full text, date, author information, and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/L4OAKN">Six million parliamentary speeches from nine countries</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-04-29-edition">DIP 2020.04.29</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Innovation licensing.</strong> Government agencies often commercialize their innovations through “<a href="https://federallabs.org/learning-center/what-is-t2">technology transfer</a>” programs, which strike collaboration and licensing agreements with outside parties.

<p><strong>Megascale coronavirus surveys.</strong> Carnegie Mellon University’s <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/about/">epidemiological forecasting group</a> and Facebook have partnered to field a <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/surveys/">large-scale coronavirus survey in the US</a>; they’ve collected <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/">more than 15 million responses since April 2020</a>. The University of Maryland has <a href="https://covidmap.umd.edu/">formed a similar partnership</a> for an international survey, in which “a representative sample of Facebook users is invited on a daily basis to report on symptoms, social distancing behavior, mental health issues, and financial constraints”; <a href="https://ischool.umd.edu/news/university-maryland-carnegie-mellon-and-facebook-team-forecast-coronavirus-spread">millions have also participated</a>. Geographically-aggregated results of the US survey can be downloaded via an <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/export/">online interface</a> or <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html">Delphi’s API</a>; the international results are also <a href="https://covidmap.umd.edu/api.html">available via API</a>. <strong>Practical example</strong>: <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2020/12/13/are-masks-widely-used-in-public/">An analysis of state-by-state mask usage, with code</a>.

<p><strong>Commodity-transportation costs.</strong> The UN and the World Bank have <a href="https://unctad.org/news/why-and-how-measure-international-transport-costs">launched</a> a new <a href="https://unctadstat.unctad.org/EN/TransportCost.html">interactive map</a> and <a href="https://unctadstat.unctad.org/wds/ReportFolders/reportFolders.aspx?IF_ActivePath=P%2C207045">dataset</a> that quantify the transportation costs for international trade — country-by-country and broken down by mode of transportation (sea, air, rail, road), trading partner, and commodity. The numbers, based both on directly-reported figures and statistical modelling, include costs overall, per unit, and per unit per kilometer. The project currently covers only 2016, but has plans to expand. [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/JanHoffmann_gva/status/1341414753567186947">Jan Hoffmann</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Millions of computational notebooks.</strong> In 2017, a team of researchers <a href="https://github.com/activityhistory/jupyter_on_github">downloaded and analyzed</a> 1.25 million publicly-available Jupyter notebooks — <a href="https://jupyter.org/">documents</a> that weave computational code, output, and text. They also <a href="https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb6931851t">published</a> the notebooks and their related metadata. Inspired by that project, a team at JetBrains recently did a follow-up scan, <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/datalore/2020/12/17/we-downloaded-10-000-000-jupyter-notebooks-from-github-this-is-what-we-learned/">analyzing and publishing data on nearly 10 million notebooks</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vaccine doses.</strong> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org">Our World in Data</a> is tracking the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations">number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered</a> per country, compiling <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations">their dataset</a> from a range of government sources, including <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/22122020-01">press releases</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nadhimzahawi/status/1339143635586207744">ministers’ tweets</a>. In addition to <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations">listing the total doses administered</a>, the US Department of Health and Human Services is also <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/distribution/index.html">publishing datasets</a> that tally how many <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/saz5-9hgg">Pfizer-BioNTech</a> and <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/b7pe-5nws">Moderna</a> vaccine doses have been <em>allocated</em> and <em>shipped</em> to each state and territory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>County-level coronavirus tests.</strong> The US federal government has finally begun publishing county-level data on COVID-19 test counts, positivity rates, and delays. And that’s just a slice of <a href="https://github.com/CareSet/COVID_Community_Profile_Report_FAQ">the information now available</a> through the daily-updated, multi-agency <a href="https://beta.healthdata.gov/National/COVID-19-Community-Profile-Report/gqxm-d9w9">Community Profile Reports</a>, which also assign each county to a “concern category” and aggregate the metrics to the CBSA, state, and regional levels. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/rypan/status/1340012957321728001">Ryan Panchadsaram’s enthusiastic Twitter thread</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Social scientists testifying.</strong> In a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230104">paper published this spring</a>, Mahler et al. describe their dataset of <a href="https://osf.io/e3h98/">social scientists’ appearances in US congressional hearings</a> — more than 15,000 instances in all, at more than 10,000 hearings between 1946 and 2016. For each testimony, the dataset indicates the expert’s name, discipline, title, and professional affiliations, as well as the hearing’s date, title, and committee. Economists predominate, followed by political scientists, psychologists, sociologists, and then anthropologists. [h/t <a href="https://deblina.net/">Deblina Mukherjee</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Permafrost.</strong> The European Space Agency <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Space_for_our_climate/Long-term_permafrost_record_details_Arctic_thaw">has released</a> new <a href="https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/1f88068e86304b0fbd34456115b6606f">longitudinal data on the Northern Hemisphere’s permafrost</a> — ground that remains 0°C/32°F or colder for at least two years.

<p><strong>People of slavery.</strong> <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/sweeping-new-digital-database-emphasizes-enslaved-peoples-individuality-180976513/">Recently launched</a>, <a href="https://enslaved.org/">Enslaved.org</a> allows the public to “explore or reconstruct the lives of individuals who were enslaved, owned slaves, or participated in the historical trade.” Its interactive database contains 600,000+ records, with plans to expand. The <a href="https://enslaved.org/about">collaborative, schlolar-led project</a> also includes <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/">The Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation</a>, which “publishes original, peer-reviewed datasets about the lives of enslaved Africans and their descendants.” The <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullIssue/volume1-issue1">first issue</a> features three datasets <a href="http://slavebiographies.org/databases.php">originally published</a> through a <a href="https://enslaved.org/projectHistory">precursor</a> to Enslaved.org — <a href="http://slavebiographies.org/about.php">Slave Biographies: The Atlantic Database Network</a>. Those <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/jsdp">datasets</a> focus on <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue1-louisiana-slave-database">Louisiana slaves</a> (1719–1820), <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue1-free-blacks-database">New Orleans “Free Blacks”</a> (1840–1860), and <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue1-maranhao-inventories-slave-database">enslaved Africans in Maranhão, Brazil</a> (1767–1831).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>More PPP details.</strong> Thanks to a FOIA lawsuit by a group of news organizations, the US Small Business Administration has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sba-releases-detailed-information-on-more-small-business-borrowers-under-ppp-pandemic-relief-effort-11606874820">released additional data</a> about the financial assistance distributed through its Paycheck Protection Program. Previously (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-07-08-edition">DIP 2020.07.08</a>), the SBA’s public data withheld the specific amounts for all loans (instead listing only a broad range), as well as names and addresses for loans below $150,000. <a href="https://sba.app.box.com/s/5myd1nxutoq8wxecx2562baruz774si6">The new datasets</a> include those amounts, names, and addresses for all loans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>More on travel/immigration bans.</strong> The <a href="https://covidborderaccountability.org">COVID Border Accountability Project</a> is tracking countries’ pandemic-related travel and immigration restrictions, on a weekly basis. The <a href="https://covidborderaccountability.org/about.html">project’s team</a> categorizes various aspects of the restrictions — whether they hinge on citizenship, halt new visa applications, et cetera — and turns them into <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/U6DJAC">a longitudinal dataset</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/covid-19-global-travel-restrictions-and-airline-information">The UN World Food Program’s travel-restrictions dataset</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-12-09-edition">DIP 2020.12.09</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Third-Republic France.</strong> Economist <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/victorgayeco/">Victor Gay</a> has built <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/TRF-GIS">a geographic dataset</a> that traces, year by year, the administrative boundaries of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic">France’s Third Republic</a>, which governed from 1870 to 1940, when the Vichy Regime took power. The dataset <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02951461">provides</a> annual shapefiles delineating the country’s départements, arrondissements, and cantons; as well as for its “most significant special administrative constituencies: military, judicial and penitentiary, electoral, academic, labor inspection, and ecclesiastical.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cyber wargames.</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920306788">This</a> is, “to the best of our knowledge, [...] the first dataset providing network traffic traces and corresponding event logs from a complex cyber defense exercise” — a two-day <a href="https://csirt.muni.cz/projects/cyber-czech">Cyber Czech</a> event in March 2019.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Global inequality.</strong> The <a href="https://wid.world/wid-world/">World Inequality Database</a> “aims to provide open and convenient access to the most extensive available database on the historical evolution of the world distribution of income and wealth, both within countries and between countries.” The project, <a href="https://wid.world/team/">co-directed</a> by Thomas Piketty, <a href="https://wid.world/news-article/2020-regional-updates/">published a major update last week</a>, expanding its geographic and temporal coverage. The data points <a href="https://wid.world/summary-table/">vary by country</a>; you can <a href="https://wid.world/data/">download them interactively or in bulk</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://fsolt.org/">Frederick Solt</a>’s <a href="https://fsolt.org/swiid/">Standardized World Income Inequality Database</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-12-04-edition">DIP 2019.12.04</a>) and the United Nations University’s <a href="https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/wiid-world-income-inequality-database">World Income Inequality Database</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-06-01-edition">DIP 2016.06.01</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Urban traffic.</strong> Researchers from ETH Zurich’s <a href="https://www.ivt.ethz.ch/en/">Institute for Transport Planning and Systems</a> have assembled <a href="https://utd19.ethz.ch/">170 million observations of traffic intensity on urban roads</a>, registered by 23,000+ detection points in 40 cities, “making it the largest multi-city traffic dataset publically available.” The cities are mostly in Western Europe, but also include Tokyo, Taipei, Melbourne, Vilnius, Los Angeles, and Toronto.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Education and civil rights.</strong> For decades, the US Department of Education’s <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/data.html">Civil Rights Data Collection</a> has compiled “data on key education and civil rights issues in our nation’s public schools,” including “student enrollment and educational programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, limited English proficiency, and disability.” Last month, the department <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-2017-18-civil-rights-data-collection">released</a> the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2017-18.html">CRDC for the 2017–18 school year</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: ProPublica has used CRDC data to investigate <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/miseducation/methodology">racial inequality</a> and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/reporting-recipe-investigating-restraint-and-seclusion-in-us-schools">the use of restraints and seclusions</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>State spending on kids.</strong> A <a href="https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/state-state-spending-kids-dataset">new dataset</a> from the <a href="https://www.urban.org/">Urban Institute</a> “provides a comprehensive accounting of public spending on children from 1997 through 2016.” Drawing on the US Census Bureau’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gov-finances.html">Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances</a> and other sources, the dataset summarizes “state-by-state spending on education, income security, health, and other areas.” [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/EricaHGreenberg/status/1300540133427613701">Erica Greenberg</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Yet more urban trees.</strong> DIP editions <a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-11-16-edition">2016.11.16</a> and <a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2018-08-08-edition">2018.08.08</a> featured datasets of trees in NYC and other cities. But wait, there's more: millions of trees in <a href="http://especiales.datasketch.co/arboles-bogota/metodologia.html">Bogotá</a>, <a href="https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/les-arbres/information/">Paris</a>, <a href="https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/stadt-wien_baumkatasterderstadtwien">Vienna</a>, <a href="https://maps.amsterdam.nl/bomen/?LANG=en">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="https://hri.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/helsingin-kaupungin-puurekisteri">Helsinki</a>, and <a href="https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/trees">Dublin</a>.
