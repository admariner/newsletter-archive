<p><strong>Human rights scores.</strong> The <a
href="https://cirights.com/">CIRIGHTS</a> project <a
href="https://cirights.com/learn-about-the-cirights-project/">aims</a>
“to create numerical measures for every internationally recognized human
right for all countries of the world.” The team has developed a <a
href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4625036">detailed
guide</a> to scoring each government’s record on <a
href="https://cirights.com/rights-we-score/">dozens of such rights</a>,
such as freedom of religion, women’s political rights, freedom from
extrajudicial killings, the right to a fair trial, and “reasonable
limits” on working hours. For each year from 1981 to 2021, the project’s
scorers have rated each country on each right, generally on a
three-point scale, based on information in the US State Department’s <a
href="https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/">Country
Reports on Human Rights Practices</a>, <a
href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/annual-report-archive/">Amnesty
International’s annual reports</a>, and similar sources. The resulting
dataset includes those scores, as well as several summary metrics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Commercial zones.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03275-3">Byeonghwa
Jeong et al.</a> have constructed a <a
href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Commercial_Boundary/24654309/4">dataset</a>
estimating the geographic boundaries of 23,000+ commercial zones in 69
metro areas in the US and Canada. To build it, they <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03275-3/tables/1">used
data</a> on retail and office locations from <a
href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, and on job
density from the US Census Bureau’s <a
href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/">Longitudinal Employer-Household
Dynamics program</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-05-26-edition/">DIP

Canada</a>. For each detected commercial zone, the dataset provides its
outline, total area, a score of its relative concentration (on which the
zone comprising most of Manhattan scored the highest), its <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area">MSA</a>,
and the street at its centroid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>National park species.</strong> The National Park Service’s
<a href="https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/">NPSpecies portal</a>
“documents our knowledge about the occurrence and status of species” on
the agency’s lands. For each NPS-managed area, you can download a list
of the species, their scientific and common names, occurrence status
(present, probably present, unconfirmed), nativeness, conservation
status, and more. <strong>Related</strong>: Noting that “many of the
observations in NPSpecies remain unverified and the lists are often
outdated,” <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02836-2">Benjamin J.
LaFrance et al.</a> have created an <a
href="https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2301647">updated
dataset for amphibian species</a>, which they checked against other
sources and verified with regional experts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Australia shipwrecks.</strong> The <a

a <a href="https://data.museum.wa.gov.au/search/type/dataset">range of

building outlines, US coral reefs, and ancient shipwrecks.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Federal inmate complaints.</strong> The Federal Bureau of
Prisons’ <a
href="https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/1330_018.pdf">Administrative
Remedy Program</a> “allow[s] an inmate to seek formal review of an issue
relating to any aspect of his/her own confinement.” In October 2022, the
<a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation
Project</a> (which, disclosure, I run) filed a FOIA request seeking
records from the agency database that tracks those complaints. In
response, BOP last month <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/federal-inmate-complaints/">provided
data</a> on 1.78 million complaint and appeal submissions filed from
January 2000 through late May 2024, spanning nearly 1 million distinct
cases. The records, <a
href="https://buttondown.email/data-liberation-project/archive/dlp-dispatch-16/">published
yesterday</a> with the help of volunteers, <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vTuyUFNqS9tex4_s4PgmhF8RTvTb-uFMN5ElDjjVHTM/edit">indicate</a>
when each filing was received, its relevant case number, complaint
subject, facility where the issue occurred, case status, status update
date, reasons for rejection/closure, and other details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Corporate AI activity.</strong> The <a
href="https://eto.tech/dataset-docs/private-sector-ai-indicators/">Private-Sector
AI Indicators dataset</a>, from Georgetown University’s <a
href="https://eto.tech/">Emerging Technology Observatory</a>, provides
“a diverse range of indicators of AI-related activity for hundreds of
companies worldwide, from startups to multinationals.” For each of the
670+ companies included, the <a
href="https://zenodo.org/records/12520760">dataset</a> counts the number
of AI-related research articles published by its employees
(disaggregated by topic), AI-related patents filed (by application area
and use-case), and workforce (overall and those estimated to be
AI-involved). It also lists each company’s main location, sector, growth
stage, and description, as well as aliases, stock listings, and
identifiers in several external data sources. <strong>See also</strong>:

<p><strong>East Asia building outlines.</strong> Recent years have seen
the development of ambitious datasets that provide the outlines of
buildings by the millions. For instance, from the archives: <a
href="https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints">buildings in
the US</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-07-18-edition/">DIP

Zealand</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-09-25-edition/">DIP
2019.09.25</a>). In the Journal of Remote Sensing, however, <a
href="https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/remotesensing.0138">Qian Shi
et al.</a> note a relative lack of such data for buildings in East Asia,
which the authors attribute “to the more complex distribution of
buildings and the scarcity of auxiliary data”. As an antidote, they’ve
generated a <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/8174931">dataset that
outlines more than 280 million buildings</a> in 2,800+ cities across
China, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, and Mongolia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>US coral reefs.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.coris.noaa.gov/monitoring/">National Coral Reef
Monitoring Program</a> collects scientific and socioeconomic/attitude
survey data related to the coral reefs offshore of the continental
United States, Hawaii, and US territories. It provides the data through

<a
href="https://www.coris.noaa.gov/monitoring/data_pacific.html">files</a>.
The scientific data <a
href="https://ncrmp.coralreef.noaa.gov/pages/ncrmp-data">include</a>
species-level coral cover, colony density, bleaching prevalence, and
disease rates; fish populations; water alkalinity and dissolved
inorganic carbon levels; and more. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Ancient shipwrecks.</strong> The <a

created <a
href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/dell-research-harvard/newswire">Newswire</a>,
a dataset of 2.7 million newswire articles published in the US between
1878 and 1977. To build it, they extracted 138 million articles from
scans of newspapers’ front pages and then used machine learning to group
those coming “from the same underlying newswire source article, in the
presence of significant abridgement and noise.” For each detected
newswire item, the dataset lists the newspapers that carried it, dates
published, the text of a representative version, its extracted byline,
dispatch location, people mentioned in the text, general topic, and
more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a

tracks the status of capital punishment in 206 independent countries
annually from 1800 to 2022. It places each observation into one of five
categories, indicating whether the death penalty is: (a) fully
abolished, (b) abolished “for ordinary crimes only,” (c) abolished for
“for ordinary crimes only but where at least one execution has occurred
in the last 10 years,” (d) <em>de facto</em> abolished, or (e) still in

<p><strong>Beach replenishment.</strong> The <a

beach-replenishing efforts</a> since the 1920s. The <a
href="https://beachnourishment.wcu.edu/about">project</a> is “a 25-year
research and data collection effort that, to the best of our knowledge,
represents the most comprehensive compilation of beach nourishment
history in the United States.” For each sand-adding “episode,” the
dataset <a
href="https://beachnourishment.wcu.edu/glossary">indicates</a> its
location, year completed, sand volume, length of shoreline treated,
total cost, primary type of funding source (private, federal, state,
etc.), and justification (shore protection, navigation, emergency dune
construction, etc.). <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

<p><strong>Hurricane forecast accuracy.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/">National Hurricane Center</a> says it
“receives frequent inquiries on the accuracy and skill of its forecasts
and of the computer models available to it.” To help answer those
questions, the agency publishes a <a

regularly-updated verification reports</a>, as well as a <a
href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify7.shtml">database
quantifying its forecast errors</a>. For each official projection since
1970, the database <a

each storm’s predicted location and wind speed to those attributes’
ultimate values. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

justices since 2000, with an estimated total value of $4.76 million. The
findings “are largely based on last year’s groundbreaking work by
ProPublica and includes data from stories in the New York Times, L.A.
Times, the congressional record, annual disclosures,” and Fix the

2019.04.24</a>), “aims to answer some of the most important questions
surrounding interactions between the internet and politics.” To do so,
they conduct surveys of experts and ask them <a

such as</a>: “How often does the government shut down domestic access to
the Internet?” and “How often do domestic elites use social media to
organize offline political action of any kind?” The survey’s <a

cover 170+ countries and provide aggregate metrics for each question.

<p><strong>Interest group positions.</strong> <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly/article/chorus-a-new-dataset-of-state-interest-group-policy-positions-in-the-united-states/6827DC9EC72301016894F265777C0078">Galen
Hall et al.</a> have compiled a <a

of “over 13 million policy positions stated by tens of thousands of
interest groups and individuals on bills in 17 state legislatures over
the past 25 years.” The authors collected and standardized the data,
which span 1997 to 2022, from lobbying and testimony disclosures. For
each of those positions, the dataset indicates the relevant bill, client
or individual represented, representative name, position phrase
(<em>for</em>, <em>against</em>, <em>monitoring</em>,
<em>undecided</em>, etc.), the date the position was reported, and <a
href="https://github.com/galenphall/chorus_data/blob/main/CODEBOOK.md">more</a>.
It also provides details about each bill from <a
href="https://legiscan.com/datasets">Legiscan</a> and the <a

Legislatures</a>, as well as client-industry categorizations from <a

<p><strong>State tax revenues.</strong> How much money do US states
collect through different types of taxes? The Census Bureau’s <a
href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/qtax.html">Quarterly
Summary of State and Local Government Tax Revenue</a> provides these
figures every three months, going back decades. The categories include
taxes on property, income, general sales, sales of specific products
(such as tobacco, alcohol, gas, and gambling), licenses, and more. For
several years now, the agency has also published <a

<p><strong>NYC shelter exits.</strong> A 2022 law requires New York City
to report the monthly number of individuals and families exiting the
city’s shelter system. Unfortunately, the city publishes those reports
only as PDFs and without a historical archive. <a

of exits for a particular city agency, family/person category, and

housing, transitional housing, medical facilities, as well as “unknown.”

Initiative</a> produces “annual publications to measure, assess, and
track the performance of global food systems toward 2030 and the
conclusion of the Sustainable Development Goals.” As part of that work,
its <a href="https://www.foodsystemsdashboard.org/">Food Systems
Dashboard</a> incorporates <a
