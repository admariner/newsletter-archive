<p><strong>FDA inspections.</strong> The US Food and Drug
Administration’s <a

dashboard</a> lists 264,000+ assessments of facilities (primarily those
manufacturing food, drugs, and other FDA-regulated products) and
227,000+ problems the inspectors found. The fields include the facility
owner, location, product type, inspection completion date, and outcomes.
The records, which go back to fiscal year 2009, can be bulk-downloaded
from the dashboard and queried via <a
href="https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/api/index.htm">an API</a>. They
come with certain caveats; they exclude, for instance, “inspections
waiting for a final enforcement action” and those conducted by state
(rather than federal) inspectors. <strong>Related</strong>: <a

working artists, and Atari emails.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Labor turnover.</strong> The US Bureau of Labor Statistics’
monthly <a href="https://www.bls.gov/jlt/">Job Openings and Labor
Turnover Survey</a> estimates the number of jobs that people quit, how
many people were fired or laid off, the number of new hires, and the
current number of open positions. Those estimates, based on data <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/jlt/data.htm">gathered from a sample
of businesses across the country</a>, are available to <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/jlt/data.htm">download and query</a> by state,
industry, and business size. They <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/jlt/jltdef.htm">include most types of
workers</a>, regardless of whether they’re full-time or part-time,
permanent or seasonal, salaried or hourly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Biodiversity trends.</strong> <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12729">Maria
Dornelas et al.</a>’s <a
href="https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/">BioTIME</a> project has
collected and standardized data from hundreds of studies examining
ecological communities over time. You can <a
href="https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/download.php">browse and search
the studies</a> by year, taxa, species, and biome. You can also <a
href="https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/downloadFull.php">download the
full dataset</a>, which provides information about each study (biome,
start/end years, number of species tallied, and much more) and each
sample collected (date, location, species, abundance, and biomass).

<p><strong>Probabilistic predictions.</strong> <a
href="https://www.metaculus.com/about/">Metaculus</a> is a forecasting
platform whose community has registered <a

million predictions</a> on questions such as “<a

a major nuclear power plant in Germany be operational on June 1,
2023?</a>” The <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/api2/">website’s

    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Billion-dollar disasters, business formations, attempted repairs,
Luftwaffe locations, and a fern tree of life.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>👋 A reader recently asked what criteria I use to evaluate
datasets for DIP. I’ve received similar questions in the past, so I
decided to write an FAQ-style public response, which you can <a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/faq/criteria/">find here</a>. It’s
a rough draft; feedback very much welcome.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Billion-dollar disasters.</strong> As “the Nation’s
Scorekeeper in terms of addressing severe weather and climate events in
their historical perspective,” the US <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/">National Centers for Environmental
Information</a> maintains an <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/">inventory of the most
costly such disasters in the US</a> — those that have caused at least $1
billion in estimated direct losses. The quarterly-updated dataset
contains more than 330 severe storms, floods, droughts, wildfires,
freezes, and other extreme events since 1980. You can <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events">download,
filter, and sort the list</a> (by disaster type, start/end dates,
inflation-adjusted cost, and total deaths), as well as <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/mapping">map</a>, <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/time-series">chart</a>,
and <a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/summary-stats">summarize</a>
it. [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Business formations.</strong> To compile its <a
href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html">Business Formation
Statistics</a>, the US Census Bureau <a
href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/methodology.html">analyzes several
sources</a>, including every application to the IRS for an Employer
Identification Number (EIN) and those applicants’ first payroll tax
filings. This allows the Bureau to provide monthly counts of business
applications and formations by <a
href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/about_the_data.html">business
type</a>, industrial sector, and state. They also publish weekly
datasets of application counts by state and an annual dataset that
drills down to individual counties; both, however, lack business
formation counts and other details <a
href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/about_the_data.html">found only in
the monthly files</a>. [h/t <a
href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28912">John C. Haltiwanger</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Attempted repairs.</strong> The <a
href="https://openrepair.org/">Open Repair Alliance</a>, “an
international group of organisations committed to working towards a
world where electrical and electronic products are more durable and
easier to repair,” is developing <a
href="https://openrepair.org/open-data/open-standard/">an open standard
for sharing data about those repairs</a>. So far, they’ve <a
href="https://openrepair.org/open-data/downloads/">gathered 62,000+
records from five partners</a>. Each entry represents a repair session:
its date and country, the product’s brand and <a
href="https://standard.openrepair.org/standard.html#product-category-values">category</a>,
the repair status, a description of the problem, barriers to repair, and
more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Luftwaffe locations.</strong> Data scientist <a
href="https://scweiss.blogspot.com/">Sam Weiss</a> has constructed a <a
href="https://github.com/samcarlos/luftwaffe_locations">dataset tracking
the World War II movements of the Luftwaffe</a>, Nazi Germany’s air
force. The information, scraped and geocoded from the Luftwaffe-history
website <a href="https://ww2.dk/">ww2.dk</a>, includes monthly locations
and aggregate statistics (total size, additions, losses) by aircraft
type and unit. <strong>Read more</strong>: A <a

<a href="https://www.openownership.org/en/about/what-we-do/">works</a>

<p><strong>Recessions and expansions.</strong> The US has no official
definition of a recession, but many observers look to the
non-governmental <a href="https://www.nber.org/about-nber">National
Bureau of Economic Research</a>, whose <a
href="https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating">Business
Cycle Dating Committee</a> tries to determine “the dates of peaks and
troughs that frame economic recessions and expansions.” The committee <a
href="https://www.nber.org/research/data/us-business-cycle-expansions-and-contractions">publishes
a table and data files</a> listing those dates for dozens of cycles
since the mid-1800s. But <a
href="https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating/business-cycle-dating-procedure-frequently-asked-questions">be
prepared to wait</a>: “Our determination of the trough date in April
2020 occurred 15 months after that date, in July 2021. Earlier
determinations took between 4 and 21 months.” [h/t <a

<p><strong>Consumer finances.</strong> Every three years since 1983, the
US Federal Reserve has conducted its <a

Consumer Finances</a>, which asks a sample of families detailed
questions about their income, savings, assets, pensions, loans, credit
lines, demographics, and more. “No other study for the country collects
comparable information,” according to the Fed. The <a

edition</a> interviewed 5,783 families <a
