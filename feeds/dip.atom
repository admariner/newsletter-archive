<p><strong>Civilian harm in Ukraine.</strong> Researchers at <a

to its <a
href="https://www.sidn.nl/en/news-and-blogs/bellingcat-uses-open-source-information-to-expose-wrongdoing">Global
Authentication Project</a> have <a
href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/02/24/russias-assault-on-daily-life-in-ukraine/">assembled</a>
a <a href="https://ukraine.bellingcat.com/">map and dataset of 1,000+
incidents</a> “that have resulted in potential civilian impact or harm
since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.” They include incidents
“where rockets or missiles struck civilian areas,” “where attacks have
resulted in the destruction of civilian infrastructure,” and/or where
visual evidence depicts civilian injuries or “immobile civilian bodies.”
The information, <a
href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2022/03/17/hospitals-bombed-and-apartments-destroyed-mapping-incidents-of-civilian-harm-in-ukraine/">collected
from public sources and vetted by Bellingcat</a>, includes each
incident’s date, location, description, sources, type of area affected,
and type of weapon system (if known). [h/t <a

<p><strong>Aid for Ukraine.</strong> <a
href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/kiel-working-papers/2022/the-ukraine-support-tracker-which-countries-help-ukraine-and-how-17204/">Christoph
Trebesch et al.</a>’s <a
href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/">Ukraine
Support Tracker</a> “lists and quantifies military, financial and
humanitarian aid to Ukraine in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war.”
The 1,400+ entries in the <a
href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/data-sets/ukraine-support-tracker-data-17410/">tracker’s
dataset</a> include contributions and commitments from 40 governments,
plus several European Union institutions. (It does not include aid from
NGOs and other non-state entities.) Each entry indicates the country,
announcement date, type of aid, total value, description, sources, and
more. The tracker’s next update is scheduled for March 29.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Municipal incorporations.</strong> <a
href="https://cgoodman.com/">Christopher B. Goodman</a>, a professor of
public administration, has consulted a range of state-level sources to
compile a <a
href="https://github.com/cbgoodman/muni-incorporation">dataset listing
the year of incorporation</a> for 18,000+ municipalities in the United
States. The dataset, which covers nearly 96% of all active
municipalities, also provides each place’s name, state, coordinates,
canonical ID in the Census, and more. <strong>Read more</strong>: In a
<a

<p><strong>Political podcasts.</strong> The <a

Political Podcast Dataset</a>, developed by the Brookings Institution’s
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/author/valerie-wirtschafter/">Valerie
Wirtschafter</a> and <a
href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/chris-meserole/">Chris
Meserole</a>, covers 50,000+ episodes from 100+ “prominent political
podcast series” — the latter based on Apple Podcasts’ popularity
rankings and its “You Might Also Like” recommendations. Updated daily
and explorable online, the dataset provides each episode’s name,
description, air date, and URL, plus the series name, partisan leaning,
and Apple Podcasts category.</p>

<p><strong>Stop signs.</strong> The City of Los Angeles publishes the <a

quarterly statistics</a> estimating the median ratio of household debt
to income in each state, county, and metro area. The published maps and
datasets, which go back to 1999, don’t include precise figures, but
rather place each geographic unit into one of ten ranges. The income
calculations <a

manually,” <a

before assessing the sounds produced.” The authors <a

    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Facilities handling hazardous chemicals, Animal Welfare Act
inspections, daily European gas imports, unclaimed estates, and data
journalists.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Facilities handling hazardous chemicals.</strong> The US
Environmental Protection Agency’s <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/rmp/risk-management-program-rmp-rule-overview">Risk
Management Program rule</a> requires facilities that handle “extremely
hazardous substances” to tell the government, at least every five years,
about those substances, their safety plans, their recent accident
history, and more. Through a <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/epa-risk-management-program/">FOIA
request to the EPA</a>, the <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation
Project</a> (<a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/about/">which, disclosure,
I run</a>) obtained a copy of the agency’s database of these filings
(minus some parts the government deems non-disclosable), containing
submissions by 21,000+ facilities from early 1999 to February 2022. You
can now <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/epa-risk-management-program-database/">access
that data</a>, in various formats, along with <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jrLXtv0knnACiPXJ1ZRFXR1GaPWCHJWWjin4rsthFbQ/edit">documentation
guiding you through it</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Animal Welfare Act inspections.</strong> The USDA’s <a
href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/">Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service</a> checks whether animal dealers, exhibitors,
research facilities, and transporters are complying with the care
standards set by the <a
href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalwelfare/awa/ct_awa_program_information">Animal
Welfare Act</a>. The agency provides <a
href="https://efile.aphis.usda.gov/PublicSearchTool/s/inspection-reports">public
access to the inspection reports</a> but no bulk data on them. So, in a
<a
href="https://biglocalnews.org/content/news/2023/02/21/usda-animal-inspection-database.html">collaboration</a>
between <a href="https://biglocalnews.org/content/about/">Big Local
News</a> and the <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data
Liberation Project</a> (same disclosure as above), <a
href="https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/">Ben Welsh</a> and I <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/aphis-inspection-reports/blob/main/METHODOLOGY.md">wrote
code</a> to fetch the 80,000+ (and counting) inspections going back to
2014, parse their PDFs, and <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/aphis-inspection-reports">make
the data more accessible</a>. The information includes each inspection’s
date, type, licensee, violation counts, species inspected, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Daily European gas imports.</strong> Researchers at <a
href="https://www.bruegel.org/bruegel-european-think-tank-specialises-economics">Bruegel</a>
are <a
href="https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/european-natural-gas-imports">tracking
daily and weekly natural gas imports to Europe</a>, using data from the
<a href="https://www.entsog.eu/">European Network of Transmission System
Operators for Gas</a>’s <a
href="https://transparency.entsog.eu/">transparency portal</a>.
Alongside the imports, which they’re aggregating by source (e.g.,
Russia, Norway, Algeria) and by route (e.g., Nord Stream, TurkStream),
the researchers are also tracking <a href="https://agsi.gie.eu/">gas
storage levels</a>, using data from <a href="https://www.gie.eu/">Gas

<p><strong>Unclaimed estates.</strong> The UK government’s <a

Vacantia division</a> publishes a <a
href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/unclaimed-estates-list">dataset
of unclaimed estates</a> — inheritances that nobody has claimed yet to
inherit. The entries indicate the deceased person’s name, aliases,
date/place of birth and death, marital status, and more.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Data journalists, surveyed.</strong> The <a

href="https://datajournalism.com/">DataJournalism.com</a> has published
a <a href="https://github.com/ejcnet/stateofdatajournalism2022">dataset
of 1,800+ anonymized responses</a> to its <a

Data Journalism Survey</a>, including 50+ entries each from the US, UK,
Italy, Germany, Spain, India, and Nigeria, plus double-digit counts from
dozens of other countries. The questions touch on demographics,
employment, training, skills, the COVID-19 pandemic, and more. [h/t <a

<p><em>👋 Free workshop! I’m teaching a PDF-parsing class at <a

<p><strong>Fair market rents.</strong> Every year, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development recalculates what it calls “fair market
rents” <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html">for
every county in the US</a> and <a
href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr/smallarea/index.html">for
individual ZIP codes in metropolitan counties</a>. The results, which
factor into various housing subsidy programs, <a
href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/24/888.113">represent</a> the
40th percentile cost of monthly rent and (basic) utilities for “recent
movers” in “standard quality” units, adjusted for the number of
bedrooms. HUD’s annual spreadsheets go back to the early 2000s; you can
also browse the estimates online and <a

via an API</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

status, health and well-being, access to basic services and demographic
outcomes” in 447 regions of 52 countries from 1990 to 2019. The
indicators include, for example, rates of home ownership, educational
attainment, and domestic violence; they’re based primarily on <a

radioactive waste</a> — “items that have become contaminated with
radioactive material or have become radioactive through exposure to
neutron radiation,” such as protective equipment and cleaning supplies.
The NRC provides <a

who speaks each line, who they’re addressing, the characters they
mention, and more. With 35,000+ quotations, the corpus “is by an order
of magnitude the largest dataset of annotated quotations for literary
texts in English.” Jane Austen is the most-represented author (five
novels), followed by E.M. Forster (two). The researchers have also <a
