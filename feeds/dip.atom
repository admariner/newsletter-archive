<p> </p>
<p><strong>Drought in the United States.</strong> “Maybe you’ve seen it in the media: that map of the U.S. painted with blobs of yellow, orange and red. It shows drought – but how do we know which colors go where?” <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/">US Drought Monitor</a>, a collaboration between the University of Nebraska and two federal agencies, <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/About/WhatistheUSDM.aspx">describes the process behind its weekly maps</a>. Its <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/About/ContactUs.aspx">authors</a>, who take turns drawing the drought-intensity boundaries, synthesize various sources of quantitative information — such as the <a href="https://wrcc.dri.edu/wwdt/">Palmer Drought Severity Index</a> and the <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/id/snow/?cid=stelprdb1240689">Surface Water Supply Index</a> — and local knowledge. The results can be <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Data.aspx">downloaded</a> as geospatial files, timeseries, and summary statistics. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/11/climate/california-western-drought-map.html">How Severe Is the Western Drought? See For Yourself</a>,” from the New York Times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Standardized testing trends.</strong> Stanford University’s <a href="https://edopportunity.org/">Educational Opportunity Project</a> uses restricted-access data on standardized test results <a href="https://edopportunity.org/methods">to estimate trends in academic performance and learning rates</a> in grades 3–8 across US schools, school districts, counties, states, and other geographies, and with respect to race, gender, and economic status. Last week the project <a href="https://edopportunity.org/whats-new/">released v4.1</a> of <a href="https://edopportunity.org/about/">their public dataset</a>, adding estimates for Native American students and <a href="https://www.bie.edu/">Bureau of Indian Education</a> schools. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-bureau-of-indian-information-hasnt-told-the-public-how-its-schools-are-performing">The Bureau of Indian Education Hasn’t Told the Public How Its Schools Are Performing. So We Did It Instead</a>,” from ProPublica and the Arizona Republic, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-performance-of-bureau-of-indian-education-schools">which compiled data for the new estimates</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Women on high courts.</strong> <a href="https://womenonhighcourts.com/researchers/">Maria C. Escobar-Lemmon et al.</a> have assembled a <a href="https://womenonhighcourts.com/data/">dataset</a> on the representation of women in constitutional, supreme, and highest-appellate courts around the world. It lists the number and percentage of women on those courts in 175 countries (from 1970 to 2013), and indicates the first year a woman was appointed to each court (updated through 2020).

<p><strong>Word origins.</strong> <a href="http://gerard.demelo.org/">Gerard de Melo</a>’s <a href="http://etym.org/">Etymological Wordnet</a> provides structured data on the relationship of words to one another, mostly mined from their semi-structured descriptions on <a href="https://www.wiktionary.org/">Wiktionary</a> as of 2013. The dataset includes hundreds of thousands of word-origin associations, among other connections. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.danielde.dev/blog/surprising-shared-word-etymologies/">Surprising shared word etymologies</a>,” a recent blog post by <a href="https://www.danielde.dev/">Daniel de Haas</a>.

<p><strong>Fox in bedroom, dog trapped in wall.</strong> The London Fire Brigade responds to hundreds of requests to rescue animals each year. Its monthly-updated <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb">spreadsheet of such events</a> goes back to 2009; it lists the location and type of property, the kind of animal and rescue, hours spent, a (very) brief description, and more.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>US vaccinations over time.</strong> The CDC has begun publishing <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh">daily-historical data on vaccination progress in the US</a>, going back to mid-December 2020. For the country overall, each state and territory, and a handful of other jurisdictions (e.g., the Bureau of Prisons), the dataset indicates the number of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and J&amp;J/Janssen doses delivered, total doses administered by age group, percentages of populations fully vaccinated, and more. Less-detailed information is also available for <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh">each county over time</a> and for <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccination-Demographics-in-the-United-St/km4m-vcsb">national demographic trends</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: My colleague <a href="https://www.peteraldhous.com/">Peter Aldhous</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/paldhous/status/1401948291093340160">incorporated</a> the CDC’s data into <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/covid-vaccine-tracker">BuzzFeed News’ vaccination tracker</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Weekly gas prices.</strong> Every Monday, the Energy Information Administration <a href="https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gas_proc-methods.php">collects data</a> “on retail prices for regular, midgrade, and premium grades of gasoline from a sample of retail gasoline outlets across the United States using Form EIA-878, <em>Motor Gasoline Price Survey Schedule A</em>.” The survey informs the agency’s <a href="https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/">average gas price estimates</a>, which are available at a national and regional level, as well as for a few selected states and cities, going back to the 1990s (though the sampling methodology changed in 2018). The EIA also <a href="https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/diesel_proc-methods.php">collects data</a> on diesel prices, using a separate survey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 and fiscal accountability.</strong> The <a href="https://www.internationalbudget.org/">International Budget Partnership</a> has published <a href="https://internationalbudget.org/covid/">an assessment</a> of accountability in the emergency fiscal policies that 120 governments introduced between March and September 2020. The report’s downloadable data (see bottom of page) includes each policy package’s name, date introduced, and whether it was a legislative act or executive decree; ratings on various aspects of transparency, oversight, and participation; and scores on 26 specific questions. <strong>Related</strong>: The partnership’s <a href="https://www.internationalbudget.org/open-budget-survey/about">Open Budget Survey</a> and <a href="https://survey.internationalbudget.org">data explorer</a>.

    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Lynching victims, gun-dealer violations, more police misconduct complaints, UK lobbying, and fermentative microbes.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lynching victims.</strong> In the 1880s–1910s, the Chicago Tribune, Tuskegee University, and the NAACP each began collecting data on lynchings in the US. In the 1990s, sociologists <a href="https://soc.washington.edu/people/stewart-tolnay">Stewart Tolnay</a> and <a href="https://sociology.uga.edu/directory/people/e-m-beck">E.M. Beck</a> reverified, standardized, and extended those three collections, compiling a now-seminal dataset that described 2,800+ victims of these mob-led extrajudicial killings — the majority of whom were Black — in 10 Southern states from 1882–1930. The researchers shared a copy of that data with <a href="http://people.uncw.edu/hinese/HAL/HAL%20Web%20Page.htm">Project HAL</a>, where you can download it. Meanwhile, they and collaborators have continued <a href="http://lynching.csde.washington.edu/#/about">updating and expanding the research</a>; you can <a href="http://lynching.csde.washington.edu/#/contact">request access to their latest datasets</a>. In 2019, sociologists <a href="http://www.charlieseguin.com/">Charles Seguin</a> and <a href="https://rigby.netlify.app/">David Rigby</a> published <a href="https://osf.io/kr8yc/">a dataset</a> that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023119841780">aims to complement Tolnay and Beck’s</a> by presenting information (<a href="http://davidrigbysociology.com/lynching_dot_map">and an interactive map</a>) on 1,328 lynching victims in 38 additional states from 1883–1941.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Gun-dealer violations.</strong> “The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives inspects thousands of licensed gun dealers and manufacturers each year, but what happens in those investigations is rarely revealed to the public.” So reporters at The Trace and USA Today <a href="https://projects.thetrace.org/inspections/methodology/">compiled</a> a <a href="https://projects.thetrace.org/inspections/">database</a> of nearly 2,000 ATF inspections between July 2015 and June 2017 with violations, based on PDFs obtained <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6170066/brady-center-to-prevent-gun-violence-v-us-department-of-justice/">through a FOIA lawsuit</a> by the <a href="https://www.bradyunited.org/">Brady gun control group</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>More police misconduct complaints.</strong> The <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> has updated its <a href="https://github.com/new-york-civil-liberties-union/NYPD-Misconduct-Complaint-Database-Updated">NYPD misconduct complaint database</a> to include “the race or ethnicity of the impacted person and officer, incident location, current employment status of the officer, and other data,” and to remove duplicates in the original records obtained from the city. <strong>Also</strong>: Philadelphia publishes <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/police-complaints">monthly-updated data</a> on police complaints from the past five years. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-ccrb/">ProPublica’s subset of the NYPD data</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-07-29-edition/">DIP 2020.07.29</a>); and <a href="https://cpdp.co/">CPDP’s database of complaints against Chicago officers</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2015-11-25-edition/">DIP 2015.11.25</a>). <strong>Read more</strong>: The Financial Times has <a href="https://github.com/Financial-Times/police-misconduct-complaints-analysis">compared and analyzed</a> these cities’ datasets, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/141182fc-7727-4af8-a555-5418fa46d09e">finding</a> that the 10% most-cited officers account for roughly a third of all complaints.

<p><strong>Lobbying in Britain.</strong> <a href="https://openaccess.transparency.org.uk/">Open Access UK</a> is a database of 70,000+ meetings between lobbyists and government ministers going back to 2012. The records have been <a href="https://openaccess.transparency.org.uk/about.php">compiled by Transparency International UK</a> from scattered official publications; they list the date of the meeting, the lobbying organization, the minister lobbied, and a brief description of the meeting’s purpose.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rainfall records, rescued.</strong> For centuries, a network of volunteers recorded monthly measurements from thousands of rain gauges across the UK and Ireland. Those observations were trapped on paper forms known “10-year sheets” until very recently, when the UK’s Meteorological Office <a href="https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_d383374a-91c3-4a7b-ba96-41b81cfb9d67">scanned them</a>. But the records still weren’t in an analyzable form, so <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue/about/team">a team of climate scientists</a> organized <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue">the Rainfall Rescue project</a>, sending <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52040822">a call for help</a> just as Britain entered its first COVID-19 lockdown. Within months, more than 16,000 volunteers had transcribed all 65,000+ pages of scans, entering <a href="https://github.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue">millions of rain measurements from 1677–1960</a>. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins/status/1392758650201120771">A Twitter thread from organizer Ed Hawkins</a>.

<p><strong>Hate groups.</strong> For decades, the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> has conducted annual censuses of US-based hate groups, <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/20200318/frequently-asked-questions-about-hate-groups">which it defines</a> as those with “beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.” <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2021/02/01/year-hate-and-extremism-2020-hate-groups-became-more-difficult-track-amid-covid-and">Its 2020 review</a> found 838 such groups — a decline from prior years, which the researchers attribute to several factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of difficult-to-track online networks, and “the continuing collapse of the Ku Klux Klan.” The center’s <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map">map of 2000–2020 findings</a> links to annual spreadsheets that detail each group’s title, location, and ideology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Law schools.</strong> <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/accreditation/">To receive accreditation</a> from the American Bar Association, law schools must submit a range of data-points about tuition, financial aid, student demographics, class sizes, employment outcomes, and more. The ABA’s <a href="http://www.abarequireddisclosures.org/Disclosure509.aspx">disclosure site</a> provides school-level PDF reports, as well as annual spreadsheets comparing all accredited schools since 2011. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/there-are-only-two-black-male-prosecutors-all-long-island">There Are Only Two Black Male Prosecutors For All Of Long Island</a>,” a recent Gothamist article that uses the data.

<p><strong>TSA screenings.</strong> In <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/foia/readingroom">its FOIA reading room</a>, the US Transportation Security Administration publishes weekly PDF files that indicate the number of people passing through its checkpoints, broken down by hour and location. IT specialist <a href="https://github.com/mikelor">Mike Lorengo</a> has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/mx87q8/tsa_throughput_dataset_alternate_source/">converting</a> these PDFs <a href="https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput">into structured data files</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: The TSA also publishes a <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput">table of total “traveler throughput”</a> for each day in 2021, compared to the same weekdays in 2020 and 2019.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>European cross-border rail.</strong> Drawing from company websites and communications with government railway agencies, <a href="https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/About-us">OBC Transeuropa</a>’s <a href="https://twitter.com/GianlucaDeFeo">Gianluca De Feo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lorferr">Lorenzo Ferrari</a> have <a href="https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/More-and-more-trains-crossing-European-borders">identified 271 passenger train routes</a> that cross Europe’s national borders. For each route, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12deGLMuX3u-mUaHGlLT0-TXIGZnQ-NILCt6NRA4s0pU/edit">their dataset</a> lists its two endpoints, the countries it passes through, route type (high-speed, regional, etc.), operating company, and more. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Europe/Four-ways-of-looking-at-European-cross-border-rail-links-209800">Four ways of looking at European cross-border rail links</a>,” a follow-up article.

<p><strong>Historical land use.</strong> The <a href="https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/index.html">History Database of the Global Environment</a>, a project of the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, provides <a href="https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/landusedata/landcover/index-2.html">land use estimates that span 12,000 years</a> — from 10,000 BCE to the near-present.

<p><strong>Union election results.</strong> The US National Labor Relations Board publishes a <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/reports/graphs-data/recent-election-results">searchable and downloadable database</a> that details the results of thousands of union elections <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/conduct-elections">the agency has conducted</a>, going back more than a decade.

<p><strong>Peace mission mandates.</strong> A team led by political scientist <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraHellmuller">Sara Hellmüller</a> has <a href="https://www.peacemissions.info/">categorized the “evolving mandate tasks”</a> of all 121 United Nations peace missions between 1991 and 2020. The dataset identifies 41 kinds of tasks, which it <a href="https://www.peacemissions.info/dataset#definition">sorts into three categories</a>: “minimalist,” “moderate,” and “maximalist.” Minimalist tasks “reflect an approach that contents itself with absence of armed conflict,” while the maximalist approach “seeks to address root causes,” such as by supporting military reform and women’s rights. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/open-data-portal">Official UN peacekeeping data</a> and <a href="https://www.pcr.uu.se/data/geo-pko/">the Geocoded Peacekeeping Operations dataset</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-11-27-edition/">DIP 2019.11.27</a>).

<p><strong>Federal Reserve Bank directors.</strong> To examine diversity in the US <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed.htm">Federal Reserve System</a>, a team led by central bank–watchers <a href="https://lgst.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/petercb/">Peter Conti-Brown</a> and <a href="https://kalebnygaard.com/">Kaleb Nygaard</a> has <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/diversity-within-the-federal-reserve-system/">compiled a biographical dataset</a> of the nearly 2,000 people who have served as directors of the system’s <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system.htm">twelve Reserve Banks</a> between 1914 and 2019. The dataset expands the information available in official reports to include “race, gender, profession, education, age, time spent in position, and whether or not the directors later held a position on the FOMC.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Water access points.</strong> Launched <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/water-point-data-exchange-launched">in 2015</a>, the <a href="https://www.waterpointdata.org/">Water Point Data Exchange</a> today describes <a href="https://www.waterpointdata.org/access-data/">577,000+ specific water access points</a>: boreholes, hand-dug wells, protected springs, rainwater harvest tanks, and more. The platform gathers information from governments and their partners in 50+ countries — mostly in Africa, but also with 10,000+ data-points each in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Haiti, and India. The records indicate the coordinates of each access point, the date checked, water availability when checked, the water source and/or transport system, and other details.

<p><strong>Foreign labor requests.</strong> In order to hire foreign workers through the government’s <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs">H-1B, H-2A, and H-2B programs</a>, US employers need permission from the Department of Labor. The agency collects and publishes <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance">data on each “certification” request</a>, detailing the employer (name, location, industry, etc.), job position (title, pay, etc.), and approval status. The datasets go back more than a decade for each program and receive quarterly updates, the most recent being posted last week. <strong>Related</strong>: At BuzzFeed News, we used the data throughout our 2015/16 <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jessicagarrison/the-new-american-slavery-invited-to-the-us-foreign-workers-f">series</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jessicagarrison/all-you-americans-are-fired">investigating</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kenbensinger/the-coyote">the</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kenbensinger/the-pushovers">H-2 program</a>, and maintain a <a href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/H-2-certification-data/">dataset that standardizes key fields from the raw files</a>.

<p><strong>Congressional scandals.</strong> In 2018, <a href="https://www.michaelgmiller.com/">Michael G. Miller</a> and <a href="https://www.brianhamel.me/">Brian T. Hamel</a> published <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912918781044">a study</a> examining how voters and donors responded to scandals embroiling members of the US House between 1980 and 2010, <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=4575902&amp;version=1.0">building on</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912912451144">the work of</a> <a href="https://www.bloomsburycollections.com/book/scandal-an-interdisciplinary-approach-to-the-consequences-outcomes-and-significance-of-political-scandals/preface">Scott Basinger and others</a>. They have since expanded <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/BID3QM">the dataset</a>, which now covers both the House and the Senate and extends through 2018, providing information on 316 legislator-scandal combinations (categorized as financial, sexual, political, or “other”) and their outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Domestic terrorism.</strong> The <a href="https://www.csis.org/programs/about-us">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a> has <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/military-police-and-rise-terrorism-united-states">analyzed</a> data on 980 domestic terrorism plots and attacks in the US from 1994 through January 2021, categorizing them as “violent far-right,” “violent far-left,” “religious,” “ethnonationalist,” or “other.” (The <a href="https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/210412_Jones_Methodology.pdf">project’s methodology</a> provides further details.) The researchers haven’t published the full dataset, but have allowed the Washington Post to publish <a href="https://github.com/wpinvestigative/csis_domestic_terrorism">a large slice of it</a> — a dozen columns for each incident, with dates, locations, type of target, and more. Based on its own research, the Post added eight more columns about the far-right attacks, which it used for a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/domestic-terrorism-data/">data-driven article on the topic</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/">The Global Terrorism Database</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-02-07-edition/">DIP 2018.02.07</a>).</p>

It covers more than 900 announcements by 39 central banks, grouped by monetary tool: interest rates, reserve policies, lending operations, foreign exchange, and asset purchases. The researchers also “provide further details relevant to each type of tool, such as the maturity and whether the instrument was new to the central bank or not.” [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlosCantug/status/1376884559237758976">Carlos Cantú</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Post offices.</strong> Historian <a href="https://www.cameronblevins.org/">Cameron Blevins</a> has released a <a href="https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/">dataset</a> of 166,000+ post offices operating in the US between 1639 and 2000. It includes their years of service and precise/approximate geocoordinates, “making it one of the most fine-grained and expansive datasets currently available for studying the historical geography of the United States.” The project <a href="https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/data-biography/">builds on research by the late Richard W. Helbock</a> and provides the data-foundation for Blevins’s new book, <a href="https://www.cameronblevins.org/paper-trails/"><em>Paper Trails: The US Post and the Making of the American West</em></a>, and <a href="https://gossamernetwork.com/">companion website</a>. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/historying/status/1377336343676608513">Blevins’s introductory Twitter thread</a>.

<p><strong>Working hours.</strong> For an article initially published in 2013 and since updated, Our World in Data has examined <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours">historical trends in the number of hours that people work</a>.

<p><strong>Fishing the Great Lakes.</strong> The Great Lakes Fishery Commission, <a href="http://www.glfc.org/about.php">whose founding was spurred by an invasion of sea lampreys</a>, publishes <a href="http://www.glfc.org/great-lakes-databases.php">several datasets</a> relevant to the famous North American basin.
