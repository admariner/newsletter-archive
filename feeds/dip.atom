<p><strong>Nursing home inspections.</strong> A couple of weeks ago,
ProPublica <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/article/here-whats-new-in-nursing-home-inspect-database">launched
a major update</a> to its <a
href="https://projects.propublica.org/nursing-homes/">Nursing Home
Inspect</a> database, originally published in 2012 (and briefly
mentioned in <a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-07-06-edition/">DIP
2016.07.06</a>). The new version “includes more data, new views that
summarize problems, and advanced search features.” As an <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-use-updated-nursing-home-inspect">accompanying
guide</a> explains, the database now “covers nearly 400,000 deficiencies
from over 90,000 reports at over 15,000 homes.” The project links to its
source data, including the federal government’s <a
href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py">list of
Medicare-certified nursing homes</a> and the date, regulation,
scope/severity, and narrative text of all deficiencies.
<strong>Tip</strong>: <a
href="https://github.com/seattletimes/nursing_homes_staffing_20200925#deficiency-data">The
Seattle Times provides guidance for downloading those deficiency
records</a>. <strong>Later today</strong>: <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/events/how-to-use-propublicas-updated-nursing-home-inspect-database">ProPublica
is hosting a webinar about the updated database</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Local ideology.</strong> “Little is known about the American
public’s policy preferences at the level of Congressional districts,
state legislative districts, and local municipalities,” <a
href="https://ctausanovitch.com/">Chris Tausanovitch</a> and <a
href="http://www.chriswarshaw.com/">Christopher Warshaw</a> wrote <a
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s0022381613000042?seq=1">in
the Journal of Politics a decade ago</a>. To address the issue, the
researchers applied Bayesian statistical methods to large public-opinion
surveys to generate numeric “ideal point” (left-vs-right) estimates at
many geographic levels. Through their <a
href="https://americanideologyproject.com/">American Ideology
Project</a>, they have since <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/americanideologyproject">updated
these estimates</a>, including <a

<p><strong>COVID-19 in deer.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39782-x">Aijing Feng et
al.</a> “collected 8,830 respiratory samples from free-ranging
white-tailed deer across Washington, D.C. and 26 states in the United
States between November 2021 and April 2022.” The researchers sequenced
the COVID-19 genomes from 391 of the samples that tested positive for
the virus, finding that the infections “originated from at least 109
independent spillovers from humans, which resulted in 39 cases of
subsequent local deer-to-deer transmission and three cases of potential
spillover from white-tailed deer back to humans.” The <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39782-x#Sec28">study’s
public spreadsheets</a> include data about each sequenced sample
(collection date, state, virus lineage, etc.), each spillover event, and
more. [h/t <a href="http://www.tmdedrick.com/">Tyler Dedrick</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Colombian public-sector algorithms.</strong> <a

system’s name, government entity, level of government (national, <a

municipal), sector, description, objectives, data used, various
categorizations, and much more. The project also includes a spreadsheet
of the 300+ sources used in the compilation.</p>

<p><strong>Forageable fruit.</strong> The <a

celebration of the overlooked culinary bounty of our city streets.” It
<a href="https://fallingfruit.org/about">provides</a> a map — “not the

— and <a href="https://fallingfruit.org/data">downloadable dataset</a>

<p><strong>Natural resources revenue.</strong> To extract minerals,
coal, oil, or gas from US federal land, Native American land, or the <a
href="https://www.boem.gov/environment/outer-continental-shelf">Outer
Continental Shelf</a>, companies must pay various royalties, rents, and
bonuses to the <a href="https://onrr.gov/about">Office of Natural
Resources Revenue</a>, which then distributes those payments — amounting
to billions of dollars per year — to the federal government, local
governments, tribes, and individuals. Through its <a

annual and monthly breakdowns of revenue, disbursements, and production,
which you can <a

other diplomats to different kinds of bilateral ambassador postings.”
The data cover 200+ countries and 10 specific years between 1968 and
2021. For each diplomat and year, the dataset indicates their sending
country, receiving country, type of diplomatic title (e.g., ambassador,
minister, etc.), and gender, which is “based on titles (e.g. Mr/Mrs,
prince/princess, baron/baroness, etc.), pronouns used when referring to
the diplomat, or the recognition of names as either female or male.” The
team has also produced a series of <a

of “all instances of US military intervention from 1776 until 2019,
alongside key drivers and consequences of these interventions.” The 392
cases include wars, occupations, major troop deployments, humanitarian
assistance, and other military actions abroad. The dataset categorizes
their objectives, use of force, and outcomes; indicates their location,
foreign states involved, starting/ending year, and human costs; and
provides many additional variables. Its sources include government
publications, media reports, other datasets (such as the <a

to rape kit backlog data</a> compiled by USAFacts, <a

Kim</a>, who led the project, has published the <a

agencies and labs provided</a>, as well as her correspondence with them.
The core data indicate the number of kits in each backlog each year
between 2018 and 2022; the backlog definition (in number of days) the
state used in the data they provided; and, of the kits received by crime
labs in 2022, how many were tested within 30 days.</p>

<p><strong>Food defect thresholds.</strong> “How many rat hairs in your

the answer in the Food and Drug Administration’s <a

Defect Levels Handbook</a>. That guide’s “action levels” table lists 180

or unavoidable defects in foods for human use that present no health
hazard.” Winchester has <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Aviation accident investigations.</strong> Through its <a
href="https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-main-public/landing-page">Case
Analysis and Reporting Online service</a>, the National Transportation
Safety Board provides information about all US civil aviation accident
investigations since 1983; <a
href="https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/AviationQuery.aspx">another NTSB
tool</a> includes earlier cases, going back to 1963. The agency also
provides <a href="https://data.ntsb.gov/avdata">bulk data downloads</a>,
covering the full span. Those files link each investigated event to
details regarding the aircraft involved, engines, crew,
injuries/fatalities, narratives, findings, and more.
<strong>Related</strong>: In February, the agency <a
href="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20230215.aspx">launched</a>
an <a

<p><strong>The top of BuzzFeed News.</strong> You’ve likely heard:
BuzzFeed Inc. has <a

down BuzzFeed News</a>, where I worked from 2014 to early 2022. In July
2018, the newsroom launched its own website, <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.buzzfeednews.com/">BuzzFeedNews.com</a>,
distinct from BuzzFeed.com. The top of the new homepage <a
href="https://github.com/jsvine/buzzfeed-news-trending-strip/blob/main/misc/trending-strip-screenshot.png">featured</a>
a “Trending” strip, with links to a handful of <a
href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/buzzfeed-news/">editor-selected</a>
articles. A few months later, I wrote a computer script to save the
text, URL, and position of each link on the strip. My personal server
ran that script every five minutes (with occasional interruptions) until
the newsroom’s final day of operation on May 5. <a

<p><strong>Forty years of financial reforms.</strong> A decade-plus ago,
a team of IMF economists published “<a
href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/A-New-Database-of-Financial-Reforms-22485">A
New Database of Financial Reforms</a>,” recording changes to financial
policy in 91 economies from 1973 to 2005. They did so “along seven
different dimensions: credit controls and reserve requirements, interest
rate controls, entry barriers, state ownership, policies on securities
markets, banking regulations, and restrictions on the capital account.”
Last year, <a href="https://sawaomori.jpn.org/">Sawa Omori</a>, a
political scientist who assisted with that project, <a
href="https://academic.oup.com/jfr/article/8/2/230/6627259">introduced</a>
a <a href="https://sawaomori.jpn.org/data/">revised and updated
version</a>, expanding the coverage to 100 economies, extending it
through 2013, and refining the seven original dimensions into 20
subdimensions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Parking reforms.</strong> The <a
href="https://parkingreform.org/">Parking Reform Network</a>, a US-based
nonprofit that <a
href="https://parkingreform.org/what-is-parking-reform/">aims</a> “to
discourage the building of too much parking supply,” has compiled a <a
href="https://parkingreform.org/resources/mandates-map/">map and dataset
of ~1,400 relevant local mandates</a>. They focus on policies that
reduce or eliminate <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_minimums_and_maximums">minimum
parking requirements</a> for new developments, or set maximums. For each
mandate, the dataset provides a summary and indicates its location,
status, category, geographic scope, affected land use, and more.

indications</a> protect traditional local producers against imitators —

<p><strong>Controlled substances lost and stolen.</strong> In response
to a <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation
Project</a> Freedom of Information Act <a
href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/controlled-substance-theft-and-loss/">request</a>,
the US Drug Enforcement Administration last week sent me <a
href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/dea-theft-and-loss-counts">data
counting the thefts and other losses</a> of <a
href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/">controlled

href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/dea-theft-and-loss-counts/tree/main/data/tidy">converted

of business (pharmacy, importer, distributor, etc.), and type of loss
(burglary, hijacking, natural disaster, etc.), plus the total quantities
stolen/lost. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a
href="https://buttondown.email/data-liberation-project/archive/dlp-dispatch-8/">Yesterday’s
Data Liberation Project newsletter</a>, featuring some numbers that
caught my eye.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>International case law.</strong> “The quantitative analysis
of international legal data is still in its infancy, a situation which
is exacerbated by the lack of high-quality open access data sets,”
writes <a href="https://seanfobbe.com/">Seán Fobbe</a> in a <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12313">2022 paper
in Journal of Empirical Legal Studies</a>. To this end, Fobbe’s
“present[s] the first two of a new series” of such resources, “covering
one hundred years of case law of the primary judicial organs of the
United Nations and the League of Nations.” The datasets — <a
href="https://zenodo.org/record/7051934">for the Permanent Court of
International Justice</a> (covering 1922–1940) and <a
href="https://zenodo.org/record/7876286">for the International Court of
Justice</a> (1947–present) — include case metadata, linguistic metrics,
and the full text (in English and French) of the courts’ opinions,
orders, and other key documents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ICE database misconduct.</strong> “Since 2016, hundreds of US
Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees and contractors have faced
internal investigations into abuse of confidential law enforcement
databases and agency computers,” <a
href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agent-database-abuse-records/">Dhruv
Mehrotra reports in Wired</a>, based on <a
href="https://airtable.com/shrodU77cgvD2e8dc/tblwELYkSA0fNXgKF">disciplinary
database records</a> Mehrotra obtained via a Freedom of Information Act
request. ICE provided 414 rows of records. Each represents an alleged
misconduct incident and provides a summary, date of occurrence, date
reported, location, several categorizations, case resolution, and more.
Wired has also added a column identifying the database in question,
based on the summary. [h/t <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Weighted, inflation-adjusted exchange rates.</strong> A
country’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reer.asp">real
effective exchange rate</a> is its average exchange rate with its
trading partners, weighted by trade volume and adjusted for inflation.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Collective nouns.</strong> <a

<p><strong>Blocked rail crossings.</strong> “As rail profits soar,
blocked crossings force kids to crawl under trains to get to school,” a

investigation</a> by <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/">ProPublica</a> and <a

addition to on-the-ground reporting, photos, and video, the article
cites the <a
href="https://www.fra.dot.gov/blockedcrossings/incidents">Federal
Railroad Administration’s database</a> of <a
href="https://www.fra.dot.gov/blockedcrossings/">blocked crossing
complaints</a>. The database’s ~70,000 reports, going back to December
2019, each list a <a

ID</a>, street, city, state, railroad, reported incident date, duration,
reason, impacts, and additional comments. <strong>Related</strong>: <a

of a <a href="https://grambank.clld.org/contributors">collaboration</a>
involving 100+ linguists, examines a range of grammatical phenomena,
“from word order to verbal tense, nominal plurals, and many other
well-studied comparative linguistic variables.” The project’s dataset,
available to <a href="https://github.com/grambank/grambank">download</a>
and explore online, spans <a

<a href="https://grambank.clld.org/languages">2,400+ languages and
dialects</a>. For instance, <a

Nomenclature</a> “provides a unique system of official names for
planetary surface features, natural satellites, dwarf planets, and
planetary rings for the benefit of the international science community,
educators, and the general public.” You can browse, <a
