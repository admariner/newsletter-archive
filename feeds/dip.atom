<p> </p>
<p><strong>Presidential schedules.</strong> Among its various White
House–related undertakings, <a
href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/">Roll Call Factba.se</a> provides
event-by-event structured data representing the public presidential
calendars for <a
href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/calendar/">Donald Trump</a>
and <a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/biden/calendar/">Joe
Biden</a> since the latter’s inauguration in January 2021. The
schedules, available to download in bulk, provide each event’s day and
time, location, a brief description, and other details. They contain
9,400+ entries from Biden’s four years in office plus another 300+ from
Trump’s second term so far. The events include those from the official
presidential schedule, those derived from <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_pool">pool reports</a>, and
press briefings. <strong>As seen in</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Water availability.</strong> The US Geological Survey last
month <a
href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/usgs-releases-a-comprehensive-look-water-resources-united-states">released</a>
its <a
href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/integrated-water-availability-assessments/national-water-availability-assessments">National
Water Availability Assessment</a>, “a pioneering scientific overview of
water availability that offers first-of-its-kind insights into the
balance between water supply and demand across the conterminous United
States.” Alongside the <a
href="https://www.usgs.gov/publications/us-geological-survey-integrated-water-availability-assessment-2010-20">report</a>,
USGS launched a “<a href="https://water.usgs.gov/nwaa-data/">data
companion</a>” <a
href="https://water.usgs.gov/nwaa-data/data-overview">providing</a>
“regularly updated, model-based estimates” of monthly water usage within
each of the country’s <a
href="https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html">hydrologic units</a>.
Estimates for water availability and water supply are “coming soon,”
while those for water quality and aquatic ecosystems are “coming
later.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>18 million deceased veterans.</strong> <a
href="https://www.birls.org/">BIRLS.org</a>, a new website from <a
href="https://www.reclaimtherecords.org/">Reclaim The Records</a>,
provides “an index to basic biographical information on more than 18
million deceased American veterans who received some sort of veterans
benefits in their lifetime”. Those <a
href="https://archive.org/details/BIRLS_database">records</a>, <a
href="https://www.reclaimtherecords.org/records-request/20/">obtained
through a FOIA lawsuit</a>, represent a substantial chunk of the
Department of Veterans Affairs’ Beneficiary Identification Records
Locator Subsystem. The site also helps you file follow-up requests for
any individual’s “full VA claims file, which may contain hundreds of
pages of never-before-seen biographical and historical material about
the veteran, their military service, and their interactions with the
VA.” <strong>Note</strong>: The “database is <em>not</em> a
comprehensive database of all American veterans, but rather a partial
and incomplete index of veterans who were eligible for VA benefits or
whose heirs had some kind of contact with the VA regarding
benefits.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Argentine treaties.</strong> <a
href="https://jisantander.com/">Javier I. Santander</a>, a career
diplomat, has built a <a
href="https://jisantander.com/ressources/bilaterals/">dataset of 8,200+
bilateral treaties signed by Argentina from 1810 and 2023</a>. It lists
each treaty’s title, status, date signed, and counterpart country. The
dataset is based on the government’s <a
href="https://tratados.cancilleria.gob.ar/">Digital Library of
Treaties</a>, where you can find copies of the treaties themselves. The
most common counterparts have been neighboring countries — Chile,
Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay — followed by Germany, the US,
and Italy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Chord progressions.</strong> <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22046v1">Spyridon Kantarelis et al.</a>
have created <a
href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/ailsntua/Chordonomicon">CHORDONOMICON</a>,
a dataset identifying the progressions of 51 million chords in 667,000+
songs. The dataset is based on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablature">tablatures</a> from the
website <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/">Ultimate Guitar</a>
and then “annotated with structural parts, genre, and release date”.
Most entries also include the <a

and artist’s IDs in Spotify’s system</a>. [h/t Dale Debber]</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hyperlocal Trump/Harris results.</strong> Earlier this month,
colleagues at The New York Times published “<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/us/elections/2024-election-map-precinct-results.html">An
Extremely Detailed Map of the 2024 Election</a>” and <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/elections/2024-election-map-data.html">made
the underlying data</a> available to <a
href="https://github.com/nytimes/presidential-precinct-map-2024">download</a>.
The effort “currently includes results for more than 110,000 precincts,
or 73 percent of all votes, and will be updated as more data is
collected.” The dataset lists each precinct’s state, county FIPS code,
votes received by Kamala Harris, votes received by Donald Trump, and
total votes (including third parties and write-ins). It also provides
each precinct’s geographical boundaries, derived from a mix of official
sources and estimations. <strong>Previously</strong>: “<a

<p><strong>Private schools.</strong> The <a
href="https://nces.ed.gov/">National Center for Education
Statistics</a>’s <a
href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/index.asp">Private School Universe
Survey</a> has been gathering <a
href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/pssdata.asp">data about private
elementary and secondary schools</a> every two years since the 1989–90
school year. It collects information on “religious orientation; level of
school; size of school; length of school year, length of school day;
total enrollment (K-12); number of high school graduates, whether a
school is single-sexed or coeducational and enrollment by sex; number of
teachers employed; program emphasis” and more. In the latest data,
covering the 2021–22 school year, “there were 29,727 private schools,
enrolling 4,731,303 students and employing 482,571 full-time teachers”.

<p><strong>Hurricane landfalls.</strong> NOAA’s <a

Research Division</a> maintains a <a
href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/All_U.S._Hurricanes.html">table
of hurricanes that have made landfall on the continental US</a> since
the 1850s. It records the year and month of landfall, designated name,
states affected, the highest <a
href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php">Saffir-Simpson
category</a>, central pressure at landfall, and maximum sustained wind
speed. The division publishes <a
href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/UShurrs_detailed.html">another
table</a> containing more details — such as the full date, latitude, and
longitude of landfall — but with a gap in the late 1970s to early 1980s.

it indicates the total funds received in 2022-23, amount committed or

<p><strong>Quits and layoffs.</strong> Minneapolis Fed–affiliated
economists <a
href="https://sites.google.com/site/kathrinellieroth">Kathrin
Ellieroth</a> and <a href="https://ammichau.github.io/">Amanda
Michaud</a> have <a
href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/institute-working-papers/quits-layoffs-and-labor-supply">constructed</a>
a <a href="https://sites.google.com/qlmonthly.com/home">new dataset on
monthly quits and layoffs</a>. Using <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/">Current Population Survey</a> (CPS)
microdata going back to 1978, the dataset estimates the proportions of
employees who, after quitting or being laid off, transition to
unemployment versus exiting the labor market. In a <a
href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2024/where-is-the-us-labor-market-heading-interpreting-the-mixed-signals">recent
article</a>, Ellieroth and Michaud note that “CPS data offer a
perspective not seen in the most-often-used series on quits and layoffs,
the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS),” featured in <a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-09-21-edition/">DIP
2022.09.21</a>. “Whereas the JOLTS tracks what happens to a
<em>job</em>, the CPS tracks what happens to <em>people</em>.” Analyzing
it, they found “that increases in unemployment are typically
<em>not</em> due to increases in layoffs; rather, they happen because
laid-off workers are less likely to quickly find a new job, more likely
to stay in the labor force, and thus more likely to join a growing pool
of unemployed people hunting for work.” [h/t <a

businesses of all sizes, private nonprofit organizations, as well as
homeowners and renters.” The SBA <a
href="https://data.sba.gov/dataset/disaster-loan-data">publishes
anonymized data</a> about each such loan in fiscal years 2000 to 2022,
drawn directly from its <a
href="https://www.sba.gov/document/report-disaster-credit-management-system-20">Disaster
Credit Management System</a>. The records provide the relevant disaster

elections, to 1990 for local elections, and to 1996 for state elections.
The files indicate each geographic unit’s number of eligible voters,
actual voters, valid votes, invalid votes, and vote shares by party. The

<p><strong>Disability claims processing.</strong> The Social Security
Administration publishes <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/data/ssa-sa-mowl.htm">monthly</a>
and <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/data/ssa-sa-fywl.htm">annual</a>
datasets tracking each state agency’s progress <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm">processing</a>
disability claims. The datasets, which go back to October 2000, count
the number of initial claims received, pending, determined, and approved
by each agency during each period, as well as similar breakdowns for
denial reconsiderations and <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-cdrs-ussi.htm">continuing disability
reviews</a>. The administration’s <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/open/data/">extensive catalog of public
datasets</a> also includes several that measure the waiting involved,
such as <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/open/data/Combined-Disability-Processing-Time.html">monthly
average initial claim processing times</a>, <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/open/data/disability_reconsideration_average_processing_time.html">average
wait times for reconsiderations</a>, and <a

<p><strong>Evapotranspiration.</strong> With the goal of “filling the
biggest data gap in water management,” the <a
href="https://etdata.org/">OpenET</a> project <a
href="https://etdata.org/methodologies/">uses satellite imagery</a>,
weather data, and other sources to estimate the volume of <a
href="https://etdata.org/faq/">evapotranspiration</a> — “the process by
which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere” — at a
30-meter resolution across 17 states in the western US. The results are
available to <a href="https://explore.etdata.org/">explore via an online
map</a> of annual cumulative evapotranspiration (2019–2024), as <a

<p><strong>Fuel forecasts.</strong> The US Energy Information
Administration’s monthly <a
href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/">Short-Term Energy Outlook</a>
provides forecasts and recent trends of energy supply, consumption,
prices, and inventory. It covers a range of commodities and electricity
sources, such as crude oil, coal, natural gas, gasoline, renewables, and
nuclear. Starting with its September 2024 report, the outlooks have also
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63384">begun to
include more detailed data on biofuels</a>, available in <a

<p><strong>Trash balloons.</strong> Since May of this year, North Korea
has floated thousands of trash-carrying balloons into South Korea. A
team from the <a href="https://www.csis.org/">Center for Strategic and
International Studies</a>’ <a
href="https://beyondparallel.csis.org/about/">Beyond Parallel</a>
project has <a
href="https://beyondparallel.csis.org/map-of-north-koreas-garbage-filled-balloons/">mapped
160+ known balloon landing locations</a>, based on public sources. The
map’s downloadable data indicates the each landing’s date, associated
“wave,” coordinates, location name, and province. <strong>As seen

<p><strong>Anglo-Saxons on record.</strong> The <a
href="https://pase.ac.uk/">Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England</a>
project “aims to provide structured information relating to all the
recorded inhabitants of England from the late sixth to the late eleventh
century.” Built over (relatively less) time by <a
href="https://pase.ac.uk/about/introduction/">several teams</a> at UK
universities, PASE is “based on a systematic examination of the
available written sources for the period, including chronicles, saints’
<em>Lives</em>, charters, <em>libri vitae</em>, inscriptions, Domesday
Book and coins.” The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book">Domesday</a>-focused
<a href="https://pase.ac.uk/domesday/">portion of the project</a>
features a downloadable table of 17,000+ landholders from that
manuscript, listing their name (where known), gender, description, value
of holdings, and linking to details about those holdings. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Landslides.</strong> The US Geological Survey has <a

the country (at 90-meter resolution) that are at greatest risk of
slides. The map and county-level metrics are also <a
href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/65ccea5bd34ef4b119cb3bac">available
as structured data</a>. To calculate the susceptibilities, <a
href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024AV001214">Benjamin
B. Mirus et al.</a> combined data from the agency’s <a

Program</a> and a <a
href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61f326dfd34e622189b93308">national
landslide inventory that they updated</a>. The latter provides the
location (as a single point or more detailed boundary), timing, number
of fatalities, and confidence level for 610,000+ landslides (or evidence
of them) in the US since the early 1900s. The researchers also consulted
data from state landslide inventories published by <a
