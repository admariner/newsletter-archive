<p><strong>Women’s well-being.</strong> <a

et al.</a>’s <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7277104">LivWell
dataset</a> presents “a set of key indicators on women’s socio-economic
status, health and well-being, access to basic services and demographic
outcomes” in 447 regions of 52 countries from 1990 to 2019. The
indicators include, for example, rates of home ownership, educational
attainment, and domestic violence; they’re based primarily on <a
href="https://dhsprogram.com/data/">data</a> from the <a
href="https://dhsprogram.com/">Demographic and Health Surveys
Program</a>, a <a

<p><strong>Radiation-contaminated waste.</strong> The US Nuclear
Regulatory Commission <a

disposal</a> of <a
href="https://www.nrc.gov/waste/low-level-waste.html">“low-level”
radioactive waste</a> — “items that have become contaminated with
radioactive material or have become radioactive through exposure to
neutron radiation,” such as protective equipment and cleaning supplies.
The NRC provides <a

statistics</a> (facility, volume, and total <a

Dialogism Novel Corpus</a> contains every quotation from 22 novels, plus
who speaks each line, who they’re addressing, the characters they
mention, and more. With 35,000+ quotations, the corpus “is by an order
of magnitude the largest dataset of annotated quotations for literary
texts in English.” Jane Austen is the most-represented author (five
novels), followed by E.M. Forster (two). The researchers have also <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eBsX2rjdLBkmA-kWB_jHCxC1nmbzinH04WUg9PeN_2A/edit">published

work in this domain.”</p>

<p><strong>Prison-banned books.</strong> The Marshall Project is
building a <a

of books banned from state prisons</a>, based on official lists that
reporters requested from each state’s correctional agency. The browsable
and <a
href="https://observablehq.com/@themarshallproject/prison-banned-books">downloadable</a>
database includes roughly 50,000 entries from 18 states so far, with
plans for expansion. The fields include the book’s title, author, date
banned, and reason for banning, although availability varies by state.

<p><strong>Presidential pardons.</strong> The US Department of Justice’s

dates for all 76,000+ pardon and commutation requests since 1989. It
also publishes a <a

tables</a>, with varying structure, listing the people who received
clemency from each president since Richard Nixon. Those tables
additionally include recipients who did not submit formal requests and,
for more recent presidents, details about the recipients’ offenses and
sentences. <a

the US Energy Information Administration “collects data on spent nuclear

from all others that possess irradiated fuel from commercial nuclear
reactors.” The agency’s <a
