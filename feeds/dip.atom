<p><strong>US facility GHG emissions.</strong> The EPA’s <a
href="https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do#/facility/">Facility Level
Information on Greenhouse Gases Tool</a> “gives you access to greenhouse
gas data reported to EPA by large emitters, facilities that inject
CO<sub>2</sub> underground, and suppliers of products that result in GHG
emissions when used in the United States.” The information comes from
the agency’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting">Greenhouse Gas
Reporting Program</a>, which also provides <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets">bulk data
downloads</a>. Per the EPA: “Approximately 8,000 facilities are required
to report their emissions annually, and the reported data are made
available to the public in October of each year.” The data, which go
back to 2010, indicate the <a
href="https://ccdsupport.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=93290546">facility
type</a>, emissions reported, <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/ghgrp-methodology-and-verification">measurement
methods</a>, types of fuel used, and <a
href="https://ccdsupport.com/confluence/display/ghgp/Detailed+Description+of+Data+for+Certain+Sources+and+Processes">much

<p><strong>Net migration estimates.</strong> Using national and
subnational data on birth rates, death rates, and population counts, <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01689-4">Venla Niva et
al.</a> have constructed a <a
href="https://zenodo.org/record/7997134">dataset of estimated net
migration</a> for each part of the world, each year between 2000 and
2019. The estimates are available as gridded data (with ~10km
resolution) and at three levels of administrative units: national,
provincial, and communal. (For the US, the latter two levels correspond
to states and counties, respectively.) The researchers have also
published an <a

gubernatorial approval polls, spanning all 50 states and going back
decades. The database, which builds on <a

<p><strong>SSVF satisfaction surveys.</strong> The Veterans
Administration’s <a

for Veteran Families</a> program aims to “to promote housing stability
among very low-income Veteran families who reside in or are
transitioning to permanent housing.” The VA outsources those services to
a network of 200+ selected nonprofits, which it grants hundreds of
millions of dollars per year. When a veteran exits a grantee’s program,
they’re invited to complete a satisfaction survey. The <a

Project</a> (which, disclosure, I run) <a

mentioned in <a
href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-07-06-edition/">DIP
2016.07.06</a>). The new version “includes more data, new views that
summarize problems, and advanced search features.” As an <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-use-updated-nursing-home-inspect">accompanying
guide</a> explains, the database now “covers nearly 400,000 deficiencies
from over 90,000 reports at over 15,000 homes.” The project links to its
source data, including the federal government’s <a
href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py">list of
Medicare-certified nursing homes</a> and the date, regulation,
scope/severity, and narrative text of all deficiencies.

the COVID-19 genomes from 391 of the samples that tested positive for
the virus, finding that the infections “originated from at least 109
independent spillovers from humans, which resulted in 39 cases of
subsequent local deer-to-deer transmission and three cases of potential

The data cover 200+ countries and 10 specific years between 1968 and

country, receiving country, type of diplomatic title (e.g., ambassador,
minister, etc.), and gender, which is “based on titles (e.g. Mr/Mrs,
prince/princess, baron/baroness, etc.), pronouns used when referring to
the diplomat, or the recognition of names as either female or male.” The

of “all instances of US military intervention from 1776 until 2019,
alongside key drivers and consequences of these interventions.” The 392
cases include wars, occupations, major troop deployments, humanitarian
assistance, and other military actions abroad. The dataset categorizes
their objectives, use of force, and outcomes; indicates their location,
foreign states involved, starting/ending year, and human costs; and
provides many additional variables. Its sources include government
publications, media reports, other datasets (such as the <a

more. <strong>Caveat</strong>: “However, a Bloomberg News analysis of

<p><strong>Rape kit backlogs.</strong> The actual number of unanalyzed
sexual assault kits in the United States is <a
href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/untested-evidence-sexual-assault-cases">unknown</a>.
But last year “at least 25,000 untested rape kits sat in law enforcement
agencies and crime labs across the country,” <a

to rape kit backlog data</a> compiled by USAFacts, <a

Kim</a>, who led the project, has published the <a
href="https://github.com/elizabethbkim/rape-kits-data">raw records the
agencies and labs provided</a>, as well as her correspondence with them.
The core data indicate the number of kits in each backlog each year
between 2018 and 2022; the backlog definition (in number of days) the
state used in the data they provided; and, of the kits received by crime
labs in 2022, how many were tested within 30 days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Global income deciles.</strong> <a

<p><strong>US fire statistics.</strong> The US <a

home to the national fire management programs of each federal fire
agency, along with partners,” such as the National Weather Service. It

dataset identifies 3,000+ location-species combinations, providing their
“establishment, eradication status, dates of introduction, habitat, and

<p><strong>Pennsylvania competency cases.</strong> Earlier this year, <a
href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/">Spotlight PA</a> and the <a
href="https://pinjnews.org/">Pittsburgh Institute for Nonprofit
Journalism</a> published an <a
href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/03/pa-mental-illness-jail-incompetent-treatment/">investigation</a>
into Pennsylvania’s competency system, which is “supposed to protect
people with mental health issues from prosecution if they cannot
understand the legal system and cannot aid in their own defense.” The
team has also published the <a
href="https://github.com/spotlightpa/competency-data-2023/">data it
received from the state’s court administrators</a>, with information
about 697 cases that involved competency proceedings between 2018 to
mid-2022. The records, available for 23 counties, indicate each case’s
court, filing date, charges, disposition, sentencing, attorneys, plus
the type and timing of 1,400+ competency-related docket filings. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Ad-targeting labels.</strong> <a
href="https://themarkup.org/">The Markup</a> has <a
href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2023/06/08/from-heavy-purchasers-of-pregnancy-tests-to-the-depression-prone-we-found-650000-ways-advertisers-label-you">obtained,
analyzed, and published</a> a <a
href="https://github.com/the-markup/xandr-audience-segments">spreadsheet
of 650,000+ ad-targetable “audience segments”</a> (described by labels
such as “Depression Propensity - Reach Tier 2”) and their data
suppliers. The spreadsheet — flagged to The Markup by privacy researcher
<a href="https://wolfie.crackedlabs.org/en">Wolfie Christl</a> — was,
until recently, linked from the website of a Microsoft-owned ad
platform. “The Markup found thousands of rows in the file that indicate
sensitive audience groupings,” including those related to medical
issues, race/ethnicity, political activity, addiction, and more. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Food defect thresholds.</strong> “How many rat hairs in your
macaroni before the FDA considers it adulterated?” asks <a
href="https://codywinchester.com/">Cody Winchester</a>, who has found
the answer in the Food and Drug Administration’s <a
href="https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredients-additives-gras-packaging-guidance-documents-regulatory-information/food-defect-levels-handbook">Food
Defect Levels Handbook</a>. That guide’s “action levels” table lists 180
criteria for 111 commodities, indicating the “maximum levels of natural
or unavoidable defects in foods for human use that present no health
hazard.” Winchester has <a
href="https://github.com/cjwinchester/fda-food-defect-action-levels">converted
the table into a JSON file</a>. <strong>The answer</strong>: An “average
of 4.5 rodent hairs or more per 225 grams in 6 or more subsamples.”</p>
