<p><strong>People of slavery.</strong> <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/sweeping-new-digital-database-emphasizes-enslaved-peoples-individuality-180976513/">Recently launched</a>, <a href="https://enslaved.org/">Enslaved.org</a> allows the public to “explore or reconstruct the lives of individuals who were enslaved, owned slaves, or participated in the historical trade.” Its interactive database contains 600,000+ records, with plans to expand. The <a href="https://enslaved.org/about">collaborative, schlolar-led project</a> also includes <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/">The Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation</a>, which “publishes original, peer-reviewed datasets about the lives of enslaved Africans and their descendants.” The <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullIssue/volume1-issue1">first issue</a> features three datasets <a href="http://slavebiographies.org/databases.php">originally published</a> through a <a href="https://enslaved.org/projectHistory">precursor</a> to Enslaved.org — <a href="http://slavebiographies.org/about.php">Slave Biographies: The Atlantic Database Network</a>. Those <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/jsdp">datasets</a> focus on <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue1-louisiana-slave-database">Louisiana slaves</a> (1719–1820), <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue1-free-blacks-database">New Orleans “Free Blacks”</a> (1840–1860), and <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/fullDataArticle/volume1-issue1-maranhao-inventories-slave-database">enslaved Africans in Maranhão, Brazil</a> (1767–1831).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>More PPP details.</strong> Thanks to a FOIA lawsuit by a group of news organizations, the US Small Business Administration has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sba-releases-detailed-information-on-more-small-business-borrowers-under-ppp-pandemic-relief-effort-11606874820">released additional data</a> about the financial assistance distributed through its Paycheck Protection Program. Previously (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-07-08-edition">DIP 2020.07.08</a>), the SBA’s public data withheld the specific amounts for all loans (instead listing only a broad range), as well as names and addresses for loans below $150,000. <a href="https://sba.app.box.com/s/5myd1nxutoq8wxecx2562baruz774si6">The new datasets</a> include those amounts, names, and addresses for all loans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>More on travel/immigration bans.</strong> The <a href="https://covidborderaccountability.org">COVID Border Accountability Project</a> is tracking countries’ pandemic-related travel and immigration restrictions, on a weekly basis. The <a href="https://covidborderaccountability.org/about.html">project’s team</a> categorizes various aspects of the restrictions — whether they hinge on citizenship, halt new visa applications, et cetera — and turns them into <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/U6DJAC">a longitudinal dataset</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/covid-19-global-travel-restrictions-and-airline-information">The UN World Food Program’s travel-restrictions dataset</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-12-09-edition">DIP 2020.12.09</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Third-Republic France.</strong> Economist <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/victorgayeco/">Victor Gay</a> has built <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/TRF-GIS">a geographic dataset</a> that traces, year by year, the administrative boundaries of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic">France’s Third Republic</a>, which governed from 1870 to 1940, when the Vichy Regime took power. The dataset <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02951461">provides</a> annual shapefiles delineating the country’s départements, arrondissements, and cantons; as well as for its “most significant special administrative constituencies: military, judicial and penitentiary, electoral, academic, labor inspection, and ecclesiastical.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cyber wargames.</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920306788">This</a> is, “to the best of our knowledge, [...] the first dataset providing network traffic traces and corresponding event logs from a complex cyber defense exercise” — a two-day <a href="https://csirt.muni.cz/projects/cyber-czech">Cyber Czech</a> event in March 2019.</p>

    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Hospital capacity, travel restrictions, the World Factbook, La Pola and her compatriots, and Bob Ross paintings.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 hospital capacity.</strong> On Monday, the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/12/07/hhs-publishes-covid-19-hospital-facility-level-data.html">released</a> a <a href="https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-facility?">dataset on coronavirus-related capacity at thousands of US hospitals</a> — information the agency previously only published <a href="https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state">as state-level metrics</a>. The self-reported, weekly-updated dataset quantifies various aspects of capacity, such as the number of staffed ICU beds and the number of beds occupied by patients with COVID-19. “This data is tremendously complex and is the result of substantial ongoing efforts,” notes an <a href="https://healthdata.gov/hhs-publishes-covid-19-hospital-facility-level-data">accompanying blog post</a>. “We opted not to have perfect be the enemy of good, so these datasets will have imperfections.” <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/CareSet/COVID_Hospital_PUF">An FAQ</a> “developed in collaboration with a group of data journalists, data scientists, and healthcare system researchers who have reviewed the data.” [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/rypan/status/1336095555852767233">Ryan Panchadsaram</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pandemic travel restrictions.</strong> The UN World Food Program has been tracking <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/covid-19-global-travel-restrictions-and-airline-information">countries’ and airlines’ travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, based on official communications, media reports, and other sources. The country-level dataset indicates whether travelers must obtain a recent negative test and what type of quarantine or self-isolation is required. [h/t <a href="https://datainnovation.org/2020/12/documenting-global-travel-restrictions-and-airline-policies/">Cassidy Chansirik</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Country facts.</strong> The CIA’s <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/">World Factbook</a> “provides information on the history, people and society, government, economy, energy, geography, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues for 267 world entities.” The details are extensive and fairly standardized. Open data–enthusiast <a href="https://github.com/geraldb">Gerald Bauer</a> has <a href="https://github.com/factbook/factbook.json">converted the publication into a series of JSON files</a>. <strong>Now you know</strong>: The physical areas of five countries (Georgia, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Sri Lanka) are all described as “slightly larger than West Virginia.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>La Pola and her compatriots.</strong> During Colombia’s struggle for independence, Royalists executed scores of women by shooting squad, the most famous of whom was the seamstress and spy known as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policarpa_Salavarrieta">La Pola</a>.” Writing last year for the <a href="https://www.banrepcultural.org/boletin-cultural/">cultural journal</a> of Colombia’s central bank, historian Pablo Rodríguez Jiménez <a href="https://publicaciones.banrepcultural.org/index.php/boletin_cultural/article/view/20880/21278">presented a list of 76 women known to have suffered this fate</a> — their names, locations, and dates of death. Colombia-based Datasketch has <a href="https://www.datasketch.co/datasketch/mujeres-fusiladas-durante-la-independencia-colombiana">converted that list into a spreadsheet</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bob Ross paintings.</strong> Data scientist <a href="https://www.jwilber.me">Jared Wilber</a> has built a dataset of all paintings in Bob Ross’s 31 seasons of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_of_Painting">The Joy of Painting</a>,” scraped from the <a href="https://www.twoinchbrush.com">searchable database at TwoInchBrush.com</a>. For each painting, the dataset lists the title, season, episode, YouTube link, and list of colors used. For <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/">a 2014 article at FiveThirtyEight</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/WaltHickey">Walt Hickey</a> created a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/">dataset categorizing the types of things Ross depicted in each episode</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDs3o1uLEdU">Where Are All the Bob Ross Paintings?

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Student loans.</strong> The US Department of Education publishes a range of <a href="https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student">aggregate datasets on federal student loans</a>, including the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/portfolio">amounts outstanding</a> ($1.5+ trillion overall, from 43 million students), volumes of financial aid <a href="https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/application-volume">requested</a> and <a href="https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/title-iv">awarded</a> (by student demographic and by school), <a href="https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/default">default rates</a>, and <a href="https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/loan-forgiveness">forgiveness</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rural facilities in India.</strong> As part of its <a href="http://omms.nic.in/">Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pradhan_Mantri_Gram_Sadak_Yojana">road-development program</a>, India’s Ministry of Rural Development has gathered data on 700,000+ rural facilities, which data-science engineer <a href="https://pratapvardhan.com">Pratap Vardhan</a> has <a href="https://github.com/pratapvardhan/rural-facilities-pmgsy">organized into state-level CSV files</a>. The information includes each facility’s name, category (e.g., education, medical, etc.), subcategory, state, district, block, address, and geocoordinates. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/PratapVardhan/status/1332174593877020673">An exploratory Twitter thread by Vardhan</a>, who says, “This is probably the largest open indian geo-tagged dataset I’ve seen!? It’s mostly great!?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>More coups.</strong> Last month, the University of Illinois’ <a href="https://clinecenter.illinois.edu">Cline Center for Advanced Social Research</a> published version 2.0 of its <a href="https://clinecenter.illinois.edu/project/research-themes/democracy-and-development/coup-detat-project-cdp">Coup D’état Project</a>, a <a href="https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-9651987">dataset</a> detailing more than 900 coups, attempted coups, and coup conspiracies from 1945 to 2019. Each entry indicates the country and date, plus the “type of actor who initiated the coup (i.e. military, palace, rebel, etc.) as well as the fate of the deposed executive (killed, injured, exiled, etc.).” <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.jonathanmpowell.com/coup-detat-dataset.html">Powell and Thyne’s coup dataset</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-07-20-edition">DIP 2016.07.20</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Jefferson’s weather.</strong> From July 1776 to June 1826, Thomas Jefferson <a href="https://jefferson-weather-records.org/node/40574">recorded</a> thousands of nearly-daily weather observations — temperatures, precipitations, humidities, wind speeds — at Monticello, Paris, Milan, and scores of other locations.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Global inequality.</strong> The <a href="https://wid.world/wid-world/">World Inequality Database</a> “aims to provide open and convenient access to the most extensive available database on the historical evolution of the world distribution of income and wealth, both within countries and between countries.” The project, <a href="https://wid.world/team/">co-directed</a> by Thomas Piketty, <a href="https://wid.world/news-article/2020-regional-updates/">published a major update last week</a>, expanding its geographic and temporal coverage. The data points <a href="https://wid.world/summary-table/">vary by country</a>; you can <a href="https://wid.world/data/">download them interactively or in bulk</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://fsolt.org/">Frederick Solt</a>’s <a href="https://fsolt.org/swiid/">Standardized World Income Inequality Database</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-12-04-edition">DIP 2019.12.04</a>) and the United Nations University’s <a href="https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/wiid-world-income-inequality-database">World Income Inequality Database</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-06-01-edition">DIP 2016.06.01</a>).</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Education and civil rights.</strong> For decades, the US Department of Education’s <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/data.html">Civil Rights Data Collection</a> has compiled “data on key education and civil rights issues in our nation’s public schools,” including “student enrollment and educational programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, limited English proficiency, and disability.” Last month, the department <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-2017-18-civil-rights-data-collection">released</a> the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2017-18.html">CRDC for the 2017–18 school year</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: ProPublica has used CRDC data to investigate <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/miseducation/methodology">racial inequality</a> and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/reporting-recipe-investigating-restraint-and-seclusion-in-us-schools">the use of restraints and seclusions</a>.

<p><strong>State spending on kids.</strong> A <a href="https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/state-state-spending-kids-dataset">new dataset</a> from the <a href="https://www.urban.org/">Urban Institute</a> “provides a comprehensive accounting of public spending on children from 1997 through 2016.” Drawing on the US Census Bureau’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gov-finances.html">Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances</a> and other sources, the dataset summarizes “state-by-state spending on education, income security, health, and other areas.” [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/EricaHGreenberg/status/1300540133427613701">Erica Greenberg</a>]</p>

    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Pregnancy/birth/abortion rates, COVID-19 in ICE facilities, mining areas, e-bike/scooter laws, and witch trials.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy, birth, and abortion.</strong> Last month the Guttmacher Institute, a “research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights,” <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/pregnancies-births-abortions-in-united-states-1973-2016#">released</a> its <a href="https://osf.io/kthnf/">latest estimates of annual pregnancies, births, and abortions</a> among women in the US — overall, and also by <a href="https://guttinst.github.io/National-State-Pregnancy-Codebook/">age-group and state</a>. The national statistics cover 1973 to 2016, while the state-level numbers go from 1988 to 2016; both sets of estimates are derived from a combination of government data and the institute’s own <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/abortion-incidence-service-availability-us-2017">Abortion Provider Census</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/Imaddowzimet/status/1313501719406555138">An introductory Twitter thread</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 in ICE facilities.</strong> Since late March, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been <a href="https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus">updating a webpage</a> that tallies coronavirus cases and deaths at each of its detention facilities. But the site doesn’t provide any historical numbers; it’s just a snapshot. To fill that gap, the <a href="https://www.vera.org/">Vera Institute of Justice</a> has been continually downloading the webpage, parsing it, and <a href="https://github.com/vera-institute/ice-detention-covid">turning the information into structured, longitudinal data</a>. <strong>Related:</strong> Over the summer, <a href="https://www.vera.org/the-hidden-curve-covid-19-in-ice-detention">Vera used the data to estimate “the true scope” of COVID-19 in ICE detention</a>, and called on the agency to provide more detailed statistics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mining areas.</strong> A team of academics has built a <a href="https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.910894">dataset</a> and <a href="https://www.fineprint.global/visualisations/viewer/">map</a> indicating the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00624-w">geographic extents of 6,000+ mining sites around the world</a>. The project traces out 21,000+ polygons covering 57,000+ square kilometers, with boundaries based on experts’ visual interpretation of satellite imagery. It focuses on “above-ground features,” such as “open cuts, tailings dams, waste rock dumps, water ponds, and processing infrastructure.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>E-bike and e-scooter laws.</strong> A dataset of <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/W9NGI2">state regulations pertaining to standard bicycles, electric bicycles, and electric scooters</a> accompanies <a href="https://repository.law.umich.edu/jlm/vol2020/iss1/2/">a recent paper in the Journal of Law and Mobility</a>. It includes various classifications for each state — indicating, for instance, whether riders can use the sidewalk, whether adults must wear helmets, and whether DUI laws apply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Witch trials.</strong> Some years ago, economists <a href="https://economics.gmu.edu/people/pleeson">Peter T. Leeson</a> and <a href="https://www.jakeruss.com/">Jake Russ</a> compiled a <a href="https://github.com/JakeRuss/witch-trials">dataset of 10,000+ witch trials in Europe</a>. Over the course of 550 years, the trials accused more than 43,000 people and led to 16,000 deaths. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.peterleeson.com/Witch_Trials.pdf">Leeson and Russ’s academic paper analyzing the data</a> (PDF). <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Research/witches/">The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-01-27-edition">DIP 2016.01.27</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Voting equipment.</strong> <a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/">Verified Voting</a> is “a non-partisan organization focused exclusively on the critical role technology plays in election administration," and its <a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/verifier/">Verifier project</a> provides “the only comprehensive data set of voting equipment down to the precinct level of the United States, going back to 2006.” For each election year and jurisdiction, the database indicates the type of technology in use (ranging from hand-counted paper ballots to touchscreen systems), equipment brands and models, and other details, such as whether there is a “voter-verified paper audit trail.” [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/jonpcohen">Jonathan Cohen</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Jail deaths.</strong> Last week, Reuters published an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-deaths/">investigation into deaths in US jails</a>. Because the federal government doesn’t publish jail-by-jail mortality data, reporters “filed more than 1,500 records requests to obtain information about deaths in 523 U.S. jails – every jail with an average population of 750 or more inmates, and the 10 largest jails or jail systems in nearly every state.” The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic/">resulting dataset</a> contains details about more than 7,500 inmate deaths between 2008 and 2019, including the cause of death, custody status, and demographic information. <strong>Among the findings</strong>: “At least two-thirds of the dead inmates identified by Reuters, 4,998 people, were never convicted of the charges on which they were being held.” [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/grantmeaccess">Grant Smith</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>College athletics.</strong> The <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/finaid/prof/resources/athletics/eada.html">Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act</a> requires thousands of US colleges to provide annual data on athletic particpation, staffing, and finances by team gender and sport. <a href="https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/">School- and team-level datasets</a> are available through the Department of Education for the academic years ending 2003–19. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/coronavirus-college-football-profit-sec-acc-pac-12-big-ten-millions-fall-2020/">USAFacts recently used the data to examine college football finances</a>. [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/sashananderson">Sasha Anderson</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bug bounties.</strong> Technology companies often offer “bug bounties” — rewards to people who tell them about vulnerabilities in their websites and apps, often coordinated through online platforms. For the past few years, security engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/arkadiyt">Arkadiy Tetelman</a> has been scraping and publishing data about <a href="https://github.com/arkadiyt/bounty-targets-data">the bug bounty “targets” listed on several platforms</a>, including the eligible domains, maximum payouts, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Shrinking salmon.</strong> Scientists <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17726-z">recently documented</a> “widespread declines in Pacific salmon size based on 60 years of measurements from 12.5 million fish across Alaska,” collected by state officials from more than 1,000 sampling locations. The <a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi:10.5063/F1707ZTM">underlying dataset</a> lists each salmon’s age, sex, length, and other details where available.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Polling places.</strong> As part of <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/topics/politics/elections/ballotboxbarriers/">a new investigative series</a>, the <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/">Center for Public Integrity</a> and <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline">Stateline</a> have published a <a href="https://github.com/PublicI/us-polling-places">dataset of polling places</a> during the 2012–18 US general elections for 30 states (and plan to add more states “in the coming weeks”). To assemble the dataset, <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/ballotboxbarriers/data-release-sheds-light-on-past-polling-place-changes">reporters filed 1,200 records requests</a>, and then converted the disparate files they received into standardized CSVs listing each polling place’s county, precinct, name, and address.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Xinjiang internment camps.</strong> In August, BuzzFeed News published a <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/china-new-internment-camps-xinjiang-uighurs-muslims">two-part investigation</a> into China’s “vast new infrastructure” for imprisoning Muslim minorities in its Xinjiang region. The reporters used a novel methodology to of hundreds of detention facilities: <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alison_killing/satellite-images-investigation-xinjiang-detention-camps">examining the gaps in Baidu Maps’ satellite imagery</a>. Last month, they published <a href="https://github.com/critocrito/xinjiang-camps-data">a dataset</a> of those facilities’ coordinates and statuses. The <a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/">Australian Strategic Policy Institute</a> has also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/24/china-has-built-380-internment-camps-in-xinjiang-study-finds">launched</a> its <a href="https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/">Xinjiang Data Project</a>, <a href="https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/data/?tab=datasets">identifying</a> <a href="https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/explainers/exploring-xinjiangs-detention-facilities/">more than 380 detention facilities</a> as well as <a href="https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/explainers/cultural-erasure/">the destruction of religious/cultural sites in the region</a>. The project — which builds on previous research <a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/report/mapping-xinjiangs-re-education-camps">by the institute</a>, BuzzFeed News, and others — classifies the detention sites into four tiers, from “low-security re-education facilities” to “suspected maximum-security prisons.” [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamYang120/status/1308950380219252736">William Yang</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Historical newspaper imagery.</strong> The Library of Congress’ <a href="https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/">Newspaper Navigator dataset</a> extracts “visual content” from more than 16 million pages of newspapers from 1789 to 1963, drawn from the library’s <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/">Chronicling America project</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-08-16-edition">DIP 2017.08.16</a>). To compile the dataset, its creators <a href="https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/newspaper-navigator">used machine learning</a> to detect seven types of visuals: photos, illustrations, maps, comics, editorial cartoons, headlines, and ads. They also built <a href="https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/search">an interactive search tool</a>.

<p><strong>A who’s who of historical China.</strong> The <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/cbdb">China Biographical Database</a> is packed with details on “approximately 470,000 individuals” from historical China, “primarily from the 7th through 19th centuries.” The <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/cbdb/supporting-documents">extensively documented</a> records include information about kinships, social statuses, offices and postings, aliases, known addresses, and more. The project, which has a <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/cbdb/history-of-cbdb">long history of its own</a>, provides <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/cbdb/download-cbdb-standalone-database">bulk downloads</a> as well as <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/cbdb/cbdb-api">an API</a>.

<p><strong>School reopenings.</strong> Education Week is <a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/school-districts-reopening-plans-a-snapshot.html">collecting coronavirus-era reopening plans</a> “from a sample of school districts around the country.” The <a href="https://fs24.formsite.com/edweek/lpuqp09jhq/index.html">dataset</a> (free registration required) covers more than 800 US public school districts so far, and is being updated weekly. USAFacts has collected similar information <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-are-children-going-back-school-americas-225-largest-public-school-districts/">from the 255 largest US public school districts</a> as of August 17. And <a href="http://www.coronaviral.fyi/">coronaviral.fyi</a> has pulled together data on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16f99488ylGL9L1BaeqaD-yy85mayS7-BSHJS31ukiXk/edit#gid=608920111">a thousand districts’ plans</a> in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.

<p><strong>US cabinets.</strong> UX designer <a href="https://taitcha.com/">Tait Chamberlain</a> has constructed a dataset of <a href="https://github.com/taitcha/American_cabinet_appointments">all US presidential cabinet nominations</a> — including nominees appointed, withdrawn, and rejected — from George Washington’s to the current administration. The spreadsheets contain “service dates, notable scandals, education, military service, foreign birth, known minority and gender status, whether the appointee died in office, and the senate confirmation vote tallies.” <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/our-research/research-centres/nuffield-politics-research-centre/whogov/">Cabinets around the world, 1966–2016</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-08-05-edition">DIP 2020.08.05</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Papal visits.</strong> For their “<a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/zbwilewps/37.htm">Pacem in Terris: Are Papal Visits Good News for Human Rights?</a>” working paper, economists <a href="https://www.jura.uni-hamburg.de/die-fakultaet/personenverzeichnis/endrich-marek.html">Marek Endrich</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jerggutmann/home">Jerg Gutmann</a> have compiled “<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lr3qQvtReCAbke6DksuX5IoGMqwjbN_r/view">the first global dataset on papal travels outside of Italy</a>.” For each country-year combination between 1964 and 2017, the dataset indicates whether the Pope visited, who he was, and the country’s <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/HumanRightsScores">“latent human rights” score</a> for that year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Bible.</strong> <a href="https://timmorgan.dev/">Tim Morgan</a>’s <a href="https://bible-api.com/">bible-api.com</a> “provides a JSON API for grabbing bible verses and passages.” You can choose verses from six translations in five languages, and can download both <a href="https://github.com/seven1m/bible_api">the underlying code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/seven1m/open-bibles">the data</a>.
