<p> </p>
<p><strong>Disability claims processing.</strong> The Social Security
Administration publishes <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/data/ssa-sa-mowl.htm">monthly</a>
and <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/data/ssa-sa-fywl.htm">annual</a>
datasets tracking each state agency’s progress <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm">processing</a>
disability claims. The datasets, which go back to October 2000, count
the number of initial claims received, pending, determined, and approved
by each agency during each period, as well as similar breakdowns for
denial reconsiderations and <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-cdrs-ussi.htm">continuing disability
reviews</a>. The administration’s <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/open/data/">extensive catalog of public
datasets</a> also includes several that measure the waiting involved,
such as <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/open/data/Combined-Disability-Processing-Time.html">monthly
average initial claim processing times</a>, <a
href="https://www.ssa.gov/open/data/disability_reconsideration_average_processing_time.html">average

<p><strong>Evapotranspiration.</strong> With the goal of “filling the
biggest data gap in water management,” the <a
href="https://etdata.org/">OpenET</a> project <a
href="https://etdata.org/methodologies/">uses satellite imagery</a>,
weather data, and other sources to estimate the volume of <a
href="https://etdata.org/faq/">evapotranspiration</a> — “the process by
which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere” — at a
30-meter resolution across 17 states in the western US. The results are
available to <a href="https://explore.etdata.org/">explore via an online
map</a> of annual cumulative evapotranspiration (2019–2024), as <a

<p><strong>Fuel forecasts.</strong> The US Energy Information
Administration’s monthly <a
href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/">Short-Term Energy Outlook</a>
provides forecasts and recent trends of energy supply, consumption,
prices, and inventory. It covers a range of commodities and electricity
sources, such as crude oil, coal, natural gas, gasoline, renewables, and
nuclear. Starting with its September 2024 report, the outlooks have also
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63384">begun to
include more detailed data on biofuels</a>, available in <a

<p><strong>Trash balloons.</strong> Since May of this year, North Korea
has floated thousands of trash-carrying balloons into South Korea. A
team from the <a href="https://www.csis.org/">Center for Strategic and
International Studies</a>’ <a
href="https://beyondparallel.csis.org/about/">Beyond Parallel</a>
project has <a
href="https://beyondparallel.csis.org/map-of-north-koreas-garbage-filled-balloons/">mapped
160+ known balloon landing locations</a>, based on public sources. The
map’s downloadable data indicates the each landing’s date, associated
“wave,” coordinates, location name, and province. <strong>As seen

<p><strong>Anglo-Saxons on record.</strong> The <a
href="https://pase.ac.uk/">Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England</a>
project “aims to provide structured information relating to all the
recorded inhabitants of England from the late sixth to the late eleventh
century.” Built over (relatively less) time by <a
href="https://pase.ac.uk/about/introduction/">several teams</a> at UK
universities, PASE is “based on a systematic examination of the
available written sources for the period, including chronicles, saints’
<em>Lives</em>, charters, <em>libri vitae</em>, inscriptions, Domesday
Book and coins.” The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book">Domesday</a>-focused
<a href="https://pase.ac.uk/domesday/">portion of the project</a>
features a downloadable table of 17,000+ landholders from that
manuscript, listing their name (where known), gender, description, value
of holdings, and linking to details about those holdings. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Landslides.</strong> The US Geological Survey has <a

the country (at 90-meter resolution) that are at greatest risk of
slides. The map and county-level metrics are also <a
href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/65ccea5bd34ef4b119cb3bac">available
as structured data</a>. To calculate the susceptibilities, <a
href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024AV001214">Benjamin
B. Mirus et al.</a> combined data from the agency’s <a

Program</a> and a <a
href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61f326dfd34e622189b93308">national
landslide inventory that they updated</a>. The latter provides the
location (as a single point or more detailed boundary), timing, number
of fatalities, and confidence level for 610,000+ landslides (or evidence
of them) in the US since the early 1900s. The researchers also consulted
data from state landslide inventories published by <a

<p><strong>Italian tax-to-charity allocations.</strong> Italy’s “five
per thousand” program allows taxpayers to allocate 0.5% of their income
tax to certain nonprofits, research institutions, and other
social-benefit organizations. The country’s Ministry of Economy and
Finance has <a
href="https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/elenco-complessivo-degli-enti-ammessi-in-una-o-piu-categorie-di-beneficiari">published
information about 2022’s beneficiaries</a>, but <a

<p><strong>H-1B lotteries.</strong> A <a

Bloomberg News investigation</a> into the US government’s annual H-1B
lottery, a key step in allocating the country’s skilled-worker visas,
finds that “thousands of companies got an unfair advantage by helping
themselves to extra lottery tickets.” To reach those conclusions, the
team “obtained data on all H-1B lottery registrations, selections, and
petitions for fiscal years 2021 through 2024 after bringing a lawsuit
against the Department of Homeland Security under the Freedom of
Information Act.” They’ve <a
href="https://github.com/BloombergGraphics/2024-h1b-immigration-data">shared
the records</a>, which indicate each registration’s employer, as well as
the proposed beneficiary’s gender, nationality, and birth year. For
registrations that led to visa petitions, the data include additional
details, such as the worksite, salary, job title, and beneficiary’s
field of study. [h/t <a

<p><strong>The Freedman’s Bank.</strong> The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman%27s_Savings_Bank">Freedman’s
Savings and Trust Company</a> was chartered by Congress in 1865, toward
the end of the Civil War, to provide banking services to formerly
enslaved Americans. “Though the bank achieved some early successes, it
failed catastrophically in 1874, destroying the savings of a broad swath
of newly freed black citizens,” write <a
href="https://www.malcolmwardlaw.info/">Malcolm Wardlaw</a> and <a
href="https://www.virginiatraweek.com/">Virginia Traweek</a>, who have
<a href="https://freedmansbank.uga.edu/">constructed several
datasets</a> based on handwritten records preserved by the federal
government. One dataset lists <a
href="https://freedmansbank.uga.edu/project/passbooks/">5,000+
transactions</a> from 500+ accounts’ “passbooks”, indicating the account
holder, city, transaction type, date, and amount. Another lists <a

accounts’ final balances</a> at the time of the bank’s failure.

<p><strong>Recreational boating accidents.</strong> In the US,
recreational boaters <a
href="https://uscgboating.org/recreational-boaters/accident-reporting.php">must
notify state authorities</a> soon after any incident involving a death,
serious injury, disappearance, or substantial damage. The authorities
relay those notifications to the Coast Guard, which stores them in its
centralized <a
href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhsuscgpia-011-boating-accident-report-database-bard">Boating
Accident Report Database</a>. The <a

a few states and territories withheld their incidents from disclosure.

collected from 11 states, the <a
href="https://data.msdlive.org/records/h79e1-k3h91">harmonized
dataset</a> “provides consistent unique identifiers for each spatial
unit of water management across the domain, unique identifiers for each
water right record, and a consistent categorization scheme that puts
each water right record into one of 7 broad use categories.” Those
categories: irrigation, domestic, livestock, fish, industrial,
environmental, and other. The authors have also published a <a

<p><strong>Ballots cast.</strong> “Electronic records of actual ballots
cast (cast vote records) are available to the public in some
jurisdictions,” <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=10404813&amp;version=1.0">Shiro
Kuriwaki et al.</a> write. “However, they have been released in a
variety of formats and have not been independently evaluated.” So the
researchers have <a
href="https://github.com/kuriwaki/cvr_harvard-mit_scripts">constructed</a>
a <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PQQ3KV">standardized
dataset</a> representing 40.7 million (anonymous) ballots in the
November 2020 general election, spanning 352 counties across 20 states.
Each of the 160 million rows corresponds to a voter’s choice in a
particular race and indicates the precinct, legislative district, office
in question, candidate selected, and candidate’s party. The initial
release, which the authors use to analyze <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-ticket_voting">ticket-splitting</a>
patterns, <a
href="https://x.com/shirokuriwaki/status/1816213954194202733">covers</a>
votes for president, Senate, House, governor, and state legislature.

<p><strong>Hurricane evacuation orders.</strong> <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03100-x">Harsh Anand et
al.</a>’s <a href="https://www.hurrevacorder.info/">Hurricane Evacuation
Order Database</a> “is a comprehensive and standardized database of
evacuation orders issued by state and local government officials in
response to the hurricanes that impacted the United States between 2014
and 2023.” To build it, the authors combed through government websites,
official social media, news reports, and other sources. The database
covers 27 storms and several types of announcements: state-of-emergency
declarations, mandatory evacuations, voluntary evacuations, and the
lifting of those orders. For each announcement, the database indicates
the order type, date/time announced, date/time effective, counties
affected, and evacuation area.</p>

<p><strong>Scholarship, networked.</strong> <a

which the authors attribute “to the more complex distribution of
buildings and the scarcity of auxiliary data”. As an antidote, they’ve
generated a <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/8174931">dataset that
outlines more than 280 million buildings</a> in 2,800+ cities across
China, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, and Mongolia.</p>

<p><strong>US coral reefs.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.coris.noaa.gov/monitoring/">National Coral Reef
Monitoring Program</a> collects scientific and socioeconomic/attitude
survey data related to the coral reefs offshore of the continental
United States, Hawaii, and US territories. It provides the data through
<a href="https://ncrmp-visualization-tool-noaa.hub.arcgis.com/">public
visualizations</a> as well as <a

<a

The scientific data <a

species-level coral cover, colony density, bleaching prevalence, and
disease rates; fish populations; water alkalinity and dissolved
inorganic carbon levels; and more. [h/t <a

Geodatabase of Shipwrecks 1500BCE-1500CE</a> merges two catalogs of
ancient wrecks: <a
href="https://oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/databases/shipwrecks_database/">one
from the Oxford Roman Economy Project</a> and <a
href="https://darmc.harvard.edu/data-availability">one from Harvard’s
Mapping Past Societies project</a>. Building on scholarly research by <a
href="https://doi.org/10.2307/300882">Toby Parker</a>, <a
href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1349806/">Julia Strauss</a>,
and others, the combined effort includes 1,900+ known wrecks, listing
(where known) their coordinates, depth, estimated time period when
wrecked, year discovered, cargo, and more.</p>
