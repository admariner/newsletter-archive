<p><strong>Trans rights.</strong> <a
href="https://www.myleswilliamson.net/">Myles Williamson</a>’s <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/global-analysis-of-transgender-rights-introducing-the-trans-rights-indicator-project-trip/3C143E501E0824C8F9F0C40925965F43">Trans
Rights Indicator Project</a> “provides insight into the legal situations
transgender people faced in 173 countries from 2000 to 2021.” The <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FXXLTS">project’s
dataset</a> is “the only public dataset covering trans rights with wide
spatial <em>and</em> temporal coverage (to my knowledge),” Williamson
writes. For each country-year combination, it “includes 14 indicators
that capture the presence or absence of laws related to criminalization,
legal gender recognition, and anti-discrimination protections.” <a
href="https://www.myleswilliamson.net/trip-data">For instance</a>: Does
the country require a psychological diagnosis before someone can change
their gender on identity documents?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Home schooling.</strong> The Washington Post has gathered <a
href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data_home_schooling">data on
home-school enrollment figures</a> in dozens of US states and 6,700+
school districts over the past six academic years. Post reporters, with
help from students at American University, “trawled state websites,
contacted education officials in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia and submitted multiple public records requests” to build the
dataset, <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2023/11/09/tracking-home-schooling-an-expansive-data-set-exclusively-washington-post/">released
last week</a>. Each entry <a
href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data_home_schooling/blob/main/home_school_data_dictionary.csv">indicates</a>
the state/district, school year, and the number of students registered
for home schooling. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/2023/homeschooling-growth-data-by-district/">The

schooling at the onset of the pandemic has largely sustained itself
through the 2022-23 academic year, defying predictions […].” [h/t <a

<p><strong>Migrant arrivals in Italy.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.datibenecomune.it/about-us/">Dati Bene Comune</a>
campaign’s latest initiative, <a
href="https://datibenecomune.substack.com/p/il-numero-zero"><em>Liberiamoli
tutti!</em></a> (<em>Let’s free them all!</em>), aims to improve the
availability of Italian government data. Its first project has been to
convert the <a
href="http://www.libertaciviliimmigrazione.dlci.interno.gov.it/it/documentazione/statistica/cruscotto-statistico-giornaliero">interior
ministry’s statistics on migrant arrivals</a> from PDF reports <a
href="https://github.com/ondata/liberiamoli-tutti/blob/main/sbarchi-migranti/dati/README.md">into
spreadsheets</a>. The extracted information <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dNlByw2cMoqGorp4zPN6OULtG_jVRCe5xpl0YdKJxFE/edit#gid=1693395128">includes</a>
daily counts of sea arrivals, twice-monthly totals by nationality, and
the number of people in <a
href="https://help.unhcr.org/italy/asylum-italy/reception/">reception
centers</a> by center type and Italian region. <strong>A nice
shout-out</strong>: <em>Liberiamoli tutti!</em> <a

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Toxic wastewater spills.</strong> For a <a
href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/31102023/oil-gas-companies-spill-wastewater-in-texas/">recent
Inside Climate News investigation</a>, <a
href="https://insideclimatenews.org/profile/martha-pskowski/">Martha
Pskowski</a> and <a href="https://peteraldhous.com/">Peter Aldhous</a>
wrangled <a
href="https://github.com/InsideClimateNews/2023-10-tx-produced-water-spills">data
on 10,000+ wastewater spills</a> reported by oil and gas companies to
the Texas government between 2013 and 2022. These “spill logs” —
obtained through public records requests, then cleaned and standardized
by the journalists — correspond to <a
href="https://insideclimatenews.github.io/2023-10-tx-produced-water-spills/tx-spills-central.html">more
than 148 million gallons</a> of “produced water,” a byproduct of
drilling and fracking. The data indicate each spill’s date, location,
facility, operator, type of operation, volume of wastewater released,
volume recovered, and much more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Coffee tasting.</strong> Last month, British <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ">YouTuber</a>

virtually hosted the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fN_z4-EcOU">Great American Coffee
Taste Test</a>, during which thousands of people simultaneously
blind-tasted the same four coffees. Hoffman has published a <a

results</a>, as well as a <a href="https://bit.ly/gacttCSV+">spreadsheet
of anonymized survey responses</a> from 4,000+ participants. It includes
tasters’ demographics, general coffee drinking habits and preferences,
assessments of the four coffees, and more. [h/t Dan Brady]</p>

<a href="https://www.opioidsettlementtracker.com/about">run by lawyer
Christine Minhee</a>, asks: “Will opioid settlements be spent in ways
that bolster the public health response to drug use?” Minhee has
compiled a series of spreadsheets to help answer that question. They
track the <a

<p><strong>Childcare inspections.</strong> “Across 41 states, one in ten
licensed daycare facilities is overdue for an inspection,” according to
an <a

by USAFacts</a>, which gathered inspection-timing data for 148,000
facilities. The analysis’s downloadable datasets indicate the number of
facilities overdue (versus on-time or unknown) in each state and county,
as well as the distribution of days-since-last-inspection in each state.
Most of the inspection data had to be programmatically collected from
state portals, <a

<p><strong>Court-debt jailings.</strong> “In the absence of a clear
picture of debt imprisonment,” <a
href="https://biglocalnews.org/content/news/2023/09/14/debt-impisonment.html">Stanford’s
Computational Policy Lab and Big Local News</a> “set out in 2018 on a
first-of-its-kind data integration effort to answer the most basic
question of all: <a
href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0290397">how
many people are being jailed for unpaid court debts</a>?” To do so, <a
href="https://policylab.stanford.edu/projects/uncovering-debtors-prisons.html">the
team</a> submitted “hundreds of public records requests with county
jails”; last month, their <a
href="https://policylab.stanford.edu/debtors-prisons/">Debtors’ Prisons
Project</a> published <a
href="https://policylab.stanford.edu/debtors-prisons/data/">standardized,
anonymized versions of data</a> received from 100 counties (primarily in
Texas and Wisconsin), “totalling more than 4 million individual jail
booking records,” plus warrant data from Oklahoma and Delaware. The
datasets indicate (where available) each arrestee’s race, ethnicity,
sex, age, state, ZIP code, booking date, release date, and release type,
as well as each charge’s description, severity, and whether it
represents a “failure to pay.” <strong>Read more</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Runway incursions.</strong> The Federal Aviation
Administration maintains a <a
href="https://www.asias.faa.gov/apex/f?p=100:28:::NO:::">database of
runway incursions</a>, which it defines as “any occurrence at an
aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an aircraft, vehicle, or
person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and
take-off of aircraft.” It currently contains 30,000+ entries, spanning
October 2001 through July 2023; each <a

<p><strong>Education reform.</strong> The <a

describes 10,000+ education policy changes reported by 180+ countries to
international organizations, among other sources. The project, <a

scholars <a href="http://www.patriciabromley.com/">Patricia Bromley</a>
and <a href="https://www.riekijima.com/">Rie Kijima</a>, <a
href="https://werd.stanford.edu/database">focuses on</a>
“<em>systemic</em> reforms that envision a supra-school administrative
level and aim to impact the wider education system, rather than small
projects that target individual schools.” The <a

lists each reform’s country, year, name, and summary. Although some of
the reforms in the database were introduced hundreds of years ago, the
vast majority occurred in the last 50 years.</p>

<p><strong>Kia/Hyundai thefts.</strong> “Cities around the U.S. are
facing a staggering new normal when it comes to stolen cars,” <a

“engine immobilizers, a basic anti-theft device that is legally mandated

    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Linked historical censuses, fracking fluids, Europopulism, GitHub
metrics, and ancient places.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Censuses, linked.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.censustree.org/">Census Tree</a>, developed by <a
href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31671">Kasey Buckles et al.</a>, “is
the largest-ever database of record links among the historical U.S.
censuses, with over 700 million links for people living in the United
States between 1850 and 1940.” By the <a
href="https://www.censustree.org/our-team">team</a>’s <a
href="https://sites.google.com/nd.edu/censustreefaq">estimates</a>, the
dataset “includes over 70% of the possible links that <em>could</em> be
made for men, and over 60% of possible links for women.” To build it,
the researchers <a
href="https://www.censustree.org/methodology">began</a> with genealogy
records from <a
href="https://www.familysearch.org/">FamilySearch.org</a>, developed a
machine learning algorithm to identify additional links, and
incorporated data from other census-linking projects. Each Census Tree
row connects an individual’s <a
href="https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/HISTID">IPUMS
identifier</a> in one decade’s census to their identifier in another.
Per the project’s <a
href="https://www.censustree.org/quickstart">instructions</a>, you’ll
need to download the Census data itself <a
href="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/full_count.shtml">from IPUMS</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Fracking fluids.</strong> Since <a
href="https://www.fracfocus.org/learn/about-fracfocus">launching in
2011</a>, <a href="https://fracfocus.org/">FracFocus</a> has become the
largest registry of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking">hydraulic fracturing</a>
chemical disclosures in the US. The database, available to explore
online and <a href="https://fracfocus.org/data-download">download in
bulk</a>, contains 210,000+ such disclosures from fracking operators; it
details the location, timing, and water volume of each fracking job,
plus the names and amounts of chemicals used. The project is <a
href="https://fracfocus.org/about-us">managed</a> by the <a
href="https://www.gwpc.org/overview/">Ground Water Protection
Council</a>, “a nonprofit 501(c)6 organization whose members consist of
state ground water regulatory agencies”. <strong>As seen in</strong>:

<p><strong>Europopulism.</strong> <a href="https://popu-list.org/">The

Rooduijn et al.</a>, “offers academics and journalists an overview of
populist, far-left and far-right parties in Europe from 1989 until
2022.” <a href="https://osf.io/2ewkq/">Version 3.0 of the dataset</a>,
released last month, lists each party’s country, local/English names,
presence in parliament, and identifiers in the <a

href="https://popu-list.org/about/">comparativists and country
experts</a> classified the party (outright or “borderline”) as populist,
far-right, far-left, and/or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism">euroskeptic</a>, and
for which time periods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>GitHub metrics.</strong> GitHub’s new <a
href="https://innovationgraph.github.com/">Innovation Graph</a> datasets
present a range of quarterly metrics on the code-sharing site,
aggregated by “economy” — a concept similar to “country” but slightly
broader. (Antarctica is an “economy” in the data, for example.) The <a
href="https://github.com/github/innovationgraph">datasets</a> count the
number of developers based in each economy, their repositories and <a
href="https://github.com/git-guides/git-push">code pushes</a>, most-used
programming languages, and more. As noted in the project’s <a
href="https://github.com/github/innovationgraph/blob/main/docs/datasheet.md">datasheet</a>,
the locations are based on IP addresses, so <a

2019. The estimates are available as gridded data (with ~10km
resolution) and at three levels of administrative units: national,
provincial, and communal. (For the US, the latter two levels correspond
to states and counties, respectively.) The researchers have also

<p><strong>Eponymic streets.</strong> <a
href="https://mappingdiversity.eu/">Mapping Diversity</a>, created by
the <a href="https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/">European Data
Journalism Network</a>, “is a platform for discovering key facts about
diversity and representation in street names across Europe, and to spark
a debate about who is missing from our urban spaces.” The interactive
analysis of 145,000+ streets in 30 major European cities launched in
March, accompanied by <a

dataset</a>, which provides information for every street examined, plus
data for six more cities. Each row indicates a street’s country, city,
and name; whether it’s named after anyone; and, if so, the person’s
name, gender, and various attributes from <a

2020, including multilateral, bilateral and unilateral arrangements,
ranging from verbal arrangements to detailed written agreements.” The
dataset’s 2,200+ ceasefires span 109 conflicts in 66 countries, largely
based on news articles discussing the agreements. A team of reviewers
manually coded each instance, indicating its type and stated purpose;
sides participating; dates declared, entered effect, and ended; and

href="https://gco.iarc.fr/projects">interfaces</a> to a range of studies
and statistics. Its <a href="https://gco.iarc.fr/today/home">Cancer
Today</a> portal features tables, charts, and maps of “incidence,
mortality and prevalence for year 2020 in 185 countries or territories
for 36 cancer types by sex and age group.” Those figures come from the
<a
href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21660">latest
GLOBOCAN estimates</a>, calculated by the WHO’s <a

<strong>Note</strong>: “Caution must be exercised when interpreting
these estimates, given the limited quality and coverage of cancer data

for Veteran Families</a> program aims to “to promote housing stability
among very low-income Veteran families who reside in or are
transitioning to permanent housing.” The VA outsources those services to
a network of 200+ selected nonprofits, which it grants hundreds of
millions of dollars per year. When a veteran exits a grantee’s program,
they’re invited to complete a satisfaction survey. The <a

href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300926120">recent paper by
Clark</a> includes a <a
href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300926120#data-availability">public
version of the dataset</a>, which “details the family connections of
422,374 people with rarer surnames in England for births from 1600 to
2022.” The dataset, based in part on genealogies from the <a
href="https://one-name.org/about-the-guild/">Guild of One-Name
Studies</a>, indicates (where available) each person’s years of birth,
marriage, and death, plus indicators of literacy, sex, occupational
status, and more. [h/t <a href="http://knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/">Derek M.
