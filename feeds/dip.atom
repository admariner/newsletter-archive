<p><strong>Federal court dockets.</strong> Journalist <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-clark-3324896/">Matt Clark</a>
has compiled a <a
href="https://archive.org/details/federal-court-dockets">database of
more than 350 million docket entries</a> across more than 13 million
cases in 180+ federal courts — including the majority of district,
appellate, and bankruptcy courts. The records, which Clark collected
through the <a
href="https://pacer.uscourts.gov/help/faqs/how-can-i-receive-case-alerts-using-rss-feed">RSS
feeds that many federal courts provide</a>, span 2013 to the
near-present. Clark’s <a

database</a> provides information about each <a
href="https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/how-to-read-a-docket-latest/">docket
entry</a> (time filed, entry number, description, and URL), case
(number, name, type, and URL), and court. Although the database does not
include the docketed documents themselves, they can be retrieved via <a

<p><strong>Unaccompanied migrant children.</strong> The New York Times’
<a href="https://www.hannahdreier.com/">Hannah Dreier</a> was <a
href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/hannah-dreier-new-york-times">awarded
a Pulitzer Prize last week</a> for a “series of stories revealing the
stunning reach of migrant child labor across the United States—and the
corporate and governmental failures that perpetuate it.” That reporting,
<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/insider/searching-for-the-faces-of-child-migrant-labor.html">Dreier
has noted</a>, was partly driven by <a
href="https://github.com/nytimes/hhs-child-migrant-data">data she
obtained from the Department of Health and Human Services</a> via a FOIA
request and lawsuit. The dataset, published in December <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/28/us/migrants-children-data.html">along
with visualizations</a>, describes the placement of 550,000+
unaccompanied migrant children with local sponsors between January 2015
and May 2023: each child’s country of origin, gender, date of entry, and
date of release to a sponsor, plus the sponsor’s ZIP code and

<p><strong>Greenhouse gas giants.</strong> <a

<a href="https://influencemap.org/">InfluenceMap</a>, “is a database of
historical production data from 122 of the world’s largest oil, gas,
coal, and cement producers.” It attributes to these producers 1,421
metric gigatons of <a

emissions from 1854 through 2022. <a
href="https://carbonmajors.org/briefing/The-Carbon-Majors-Database-26913">Launched
last month</a>, the database provides <a
href="https://carbonmajors.org/Downloads">downloads at several levels of
granularity</a>. The least granular version indicates the emissions
calculated for each entity-year combination. The most granular version
breaks those emissions down by commodity produced, quantity of commodity
produced, emitting activity, and reporting entity.</p>

<p><strong>1 million ChatGPT conversations.</strong> The <a

a corpus of 1 million real-world user-ChatGPT interactions,
characterized by a wide range of languages and a diversity of user
prompts.” The researchers, primarily affiliated with Cornell and the <a
href="https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for AI</a>, built it “by
offering free access to ChatGPT and GPT-4 in exchange for consensual
chat history collection.” Each of the 1 million rows in the <a

represents a conversation and provides its text, main language,
timestamp of its conclusion, underlying model used, moderation results,

the “<a href="https://theappeal.org/commissary-database/">first national
database of prison commissary lists</a>,” based on documents provided by
46 states. The database contains <a

ramen, toothpaste, and rosary beads — across three categories: food,
personal care/hygiene, and religious items. The <a

in the 2000s for most of the countries and concludes in 2021. For each
contract, it provides information about the tender (title, procedure
type, product code, publication date, award date, final price, currency,
etc.), government buyer, bidders’ names and locations, and more. The

<p><strong>Opioid settlement payouts.</strong> KFF Health News <a
href="https://kffhealthnews.org/opioid-settlements/">has been
following</a> the slew of legal settlements by companies accused of
exacerbating the opioid crisis. Last week, they published an <a
href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/opioid-settlement-payouts-state-county-city-tracker/">interactive</a>
and <a
href="https://kffhealthnews.org/download-the-data-opioid-settlement-payouts/">downloadable</a>
database of payouts to state and local governments so far (and expected
in the future) from the largest national settlement, “a $26 billion deal
with four companies that will be paid out over nearly two decades.” The
data, <a
href="https://www.nationalopioidofficialsettlement.com/Home/StateAllocationAmounts">gathered
from the court-appointed firm administering the settlement</a>, include
overall numbers for 48 states and DC, plus locality-level data for 35
states. (Los Angeles County, for instance, received $47 million in 2022
and 2023, with another $210 million expected in years to come.)

<p><strong>Groundwater wells.</strong> Despite the infrastructural
importance of groundwater wells, “a unified database collecting and
standardizing information on the characteristics and locations of these
wells across the United States has been lacking,” <a

database of groundwater well records collected from state and federal
agencies.” Their <a

States Groundwater Well Database</a> contains ~14 million records, each
indicating a well equipped for monitoring or extracting water. Where
available, each row lists the well’s coordinates, county, aquifer,
watershed, depth, capacity, water use category, water potability, and
more. [h/t <a href="http://knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/">Derek M. Jones</a>]</p>

(also known as workers’ compensation laws) in 186 “independent nation
states.” For each, the database lists the year of its first such law,
the year a law first provided insurance for work-related injuries, the
type of program it established, and more. It also incorporates data on

information on the reach and duration of European colonial empires from
renowned secondary sources.” Producing the dataset from its four main
sources “is largely automated, relying on predefined coding rules.” The
dataset indicates the first and last years each contemporary country was
colonized, disaggregated by eight colonizing countries (Belgium,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain). [h/t

<p><strong>Power outages.</strong> <a

to monitor electric utility customer outages from data gathered from
public sources.” The data’s coverage has increased over time; by 2022,
it represented 92% of customers in the 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico.
“The remaining 8% of customers belong to utilities which do not report
outage information publicly in near-real time in a format that is
currently accessible to EAGLE-I parsers,” the authors write. “These are
most typically small, rural, municipal utilities which lack robust
information technology infrastructure.”</p>

<p><strong>Institutional investments.</strong> If you’re an
institutional investor with US operations and managing at least $100
million in publicly traded securities, the Securities and Exchange
Commission requires you to file <a

13F</a> each quarter. (The biggest filers — such as Vanguard, BlackRock,
and State Street — have trillions of dollars invested.) These filings,
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/form-13f">available to download
going back to mid-2013</a>, detail each investor’s long positions for
each security: their number of shares, market value, security type,
issuer name, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUSIP">CUSIP

<p><strong>Extrajudicial killings in Bangladesh.</strong> Between 2009

<p><strong>Human trafficking.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/page/about">Counter-Trafficking
Data Collaborative</a>’s <a
href="https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/page/global-synthetic-dataset">Global
Synthetic Dataset</a> uses <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy">differential
privacy techniques</a> to represent “over 206,000 victims and survivors
of trafficking identified across 190 countries and territories from 2002
to 2022.” The approach, developed in partnership with Microsoft
Research, converts anonymized case records into “a new dataset in which
records do not correspond to actual individuals, but which preserves the
structure and statistics (i.e., utility) of the original data.” Each row
indicates a (synthetic) individual’s gender, age group, citizenship,
country of exploitation, duration of reported trafficking, traffickers’
means of control, types of exploitation, and the year the <a
href="https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/data-contributors">collaborative’s
partners</a> registered the case. <strong>Related</strong>: The
collaborative’s <a
href="https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/global-victim-perpetrator-synthetic-dataset">Global
Victim-Perpetrator Synthetic Dataset</a>, which takes a similar approach
to relationships between victims and perpetrators. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Real-world vehicle emissions.</strong> On Monday, the

its first report</a> analyzing <a
href="https://climate-energy.eea.europa.eu/topics/transport/real-world-emissions/intro">the
real-world CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of cars and vans</a>, based on fuel
consumption monitoring devices that the EU now requires. The report uses
data received from 600,000+ vehicles. That sample is <a
href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/1c1ffad2-34c3-471b-bd69-dd013cdd7b80">available

aggregated by manufacturer and fuel type</a>: average fuel consumption,
emissions, and comparisons to <a

<p><strong>State legislators.</strong> <a

<a href="https://ehansen4.sites.luc.edu/">Eric Hansen</a>’s <a
href="https://people.duke.edu/~nwc8/stateleg.html">2023-4 State
Legislators Dataset</a> features “biographical information about state
lawmakers who held office in 2023 and 2024 compiled from legislative and
campaign websites and other online sources.” The dataset spans all 50
states and includes 7,300+ lawmakers. “The project’s principal aim was
to record the current or most recent main occupation (outside of elected
office) held by each member,” the authors write, “but the dataset also
includes information about a wide range of characteristics including
race, gender, and education.” A version for 2021–22 is <a

<p><strong>Meta Oversight Board decisions.</strong> Meta’s independent
<a href="https://oversightboard.com/">Oversight Board</a> reviews a
selection of the company’s content-moderation decisions and has the
power to overturn them. The board <a
href="https://oversightboard.com/decision/">publishes its rulings
online</a>, as does <a
href="https://transparency.fb.com/oversight/oversight-board-cases/">Meta
itself</a>; neither, however, provides a download link. But <a

has compiled a <a
