<p><strong>Groundwater levels.</strong> To assess global trends in
groundwater levels, <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06879-8">Scott Jasechko
et al.</a> have analyzed data from ~170,000 monitoring wells in 40+
countries. The researchers’ <a
href="https://zenodo.org/records/10003697">public datasets</a> include
annual groundwater levels “in all cases for which we have received
permission from a database manager to post data,” amounting to more than
4 million measurements (59% of the total). The published records also
include the boundaries of 1,600+ aquifer systems, “manually delineated
[…] using maps and descriptions from 1,236 local and regional studies.”
The study’s <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06879-8#Sec18">supplementary
documentation</a> describes each data source and method of access.

<p><strong>Military surplus.</strong> Through its <a
href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RS20428.html">Excess
Defense Articles program</a>, the US military offers free and
reduced-price equipment to foreign governments. The Department of
Defense <a
href="https://www.dsca.mil/programs/excess-defense-articles-eda">publishes
a spreadsheet of the program’s authorizations and transfers</a>, last
updated in mid–2020 and going back to 2010. Each of the 4,100+ entries
lists the foreign country, item description, transfer status, status
date, whether it was a sale or grant, quantities (requested, allocated,
accepted, rejected, delivered), “current” value, and acquisition value.
Items range in size and significance, from vinyl tape (55 rolls
authorized for transfer to Iraq in 2016) to <a

(including 178 provided to Morocco in 2018). [h/t <a

<p><strong>Study abroad.</strong> <a

initiative <a href="https://opendoorsdata.org/about/">funded by the
State Department</a>, “is the only long-standing, comprehensive
information resource on international students and scholars in the
United States and on U.S. students studying abroad for academic credit.”
Its <a href="https://opendoorsdata.org/annual-release/">annual
reports</a> provide aggregate statistics by country, field of study,
and/or institution. For example: NYU <a
href="https://opendoorsdata.org/annual-release/international-students/">hosted
more international students</a> (~25,000) than any other US university
in the 2022–23 school year, followed by Northeastern (~21,000) and
Columbia (~19,000); Italy, the UK, and Spain were the <a

popular destinations for US students</a> in 2021–22.

gross tonnage, and nominal effort,” a metric that multiplies the engine
power by the number of days at sea. Their sources include “a range of
publicly available sources, governmental reports, and grey literature”.

<p><strong>Subnational economic output.</strong> <a

al.</a>’s <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7573249">Database of
Sub-national Economic Output</a> (DOSE) provides “harmonised data on
reported economic output from 1,661 sub-national regions across 83
countries from 1960 to 2020.” Those regions include, for instance,
Turkey’s 81 provinces, Japan’s 47 prefectures, and Kenya’s 47 counties.
For each year, the dataset indicates the monetary value of the region’s
total economic output, and often also subtotals for the agricultural,
manufacturing, and services sectors. While previous projects have used
interpolation to estimate similar figures, DOSE avoids that approach,
instead <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02323-8/tables/1">assembling
its data</a> only from “statistical agencies, yearbooks and academic

and <a href="https://iea.uoregon.edu/treaty/3197">Convention on Nuclear

href="https://iea.uoregon.edu/ieadb-and-related-datasets">datasets</a>
characterize each agreement (e.g., its name, signature date, type,

The project also tracks various “non-agreements,” such as memoranda of

<p><strong>Chicago’s “menu money.”</strong> Chicago’s 50 wards can each
receive up to $1.5 million annually to spend on infrastructure projects
such as street lighting, sidewalk repair, art murals, and park
improvements. Each ward’s city council representative typically decides
how to spend this so-called “menu money,” although <a
href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/8/3/23819111/chicago-vote-tax-money-spent-wards-participatory-budgeting-democracy-solutions-project">some

<p><strong>Dengue.</strong> <a
href="https://opendengue.org/">OpenDengue</a>, a new project based at
the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, “aims to build and
maintain a database of dengue case counts for every dengue-affected
country worldwide since 1990 or earlier.” (According to a <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12060">2013 study</a> <a
href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue">cited
by the WHO</a>, the virus causes an estimated 96 million symptomatic
infections per year.) <a
href="https://opendengue.org/overview.html">Drawing from a range of
sources</a>, the team has collected weekly, monthly, and/or annual
national counts from 100+ countries so far and <a
href="https://opendengue.org/contribute.html">welcomes
contributions</a>. For each count, the <a
href="https://opendengue.org/data.html">project’s datasets</a> indicate
what was being counted: suspected cases, confirmed cases, probable
cases, or a combination. For several dozen countries, the data also
contain sub-national counts — including for 5,000+ municipalities in
Brazil and all 70+ Thai provinces. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Workforce training providers.</strong> The <a

href="https://www.pw.hks.harvard.edu/post/workforce-almanac-launch">launched
last month</a> by the Harvard-based <a
href="https://www.pw.hks.harvard.edu/">Project on Workforce</a>, maps
“almost 17,000 providers of workforce training, which we have defined as
short-term (lasting less than two years), post-high school training
opportunities in which learners gain work-relevant skills to help them
find a job.” The <a
href="https://www.workforcealmanac.com/explore">dataset</a> lists each
organization’s name, address, city, state, coordinates, and various
categorizations. To build it, the team <a
href="https://workforcealmanac.com/methodology">merged and cleaned data
from four sources</a>: the Department of Labor’s <a
href="https://www.apprenticeship.gov/data-and-statistics">Registered
Apprenticeship Partners Information Database System</a> (RAPIDS) and <a

<p><strong>Antarctic ice sheets.</strong> The <a

Research</a>’s <a href="https://bedmap.scar.org/">Bedmap Data Portal</a>
provides access to “ice bed, surface and thickness point data from all
Antarctic geophysical campaigns since the 1950s.” In <a
href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2695/2023/essd-15-2695-2023.html">an
accompanying paper</a>, Alice C. Frémand et al. describe the process
they undertook to standardize decades of ice-survey data and to <a

the outputs</a> based on “<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data">findable, accessible,
interoperable, and reusable</a>” (FAIR) data principles. In all, the
records contain “82 million data points collected as part of 277
campaigns,” spanning three generations of data.

position between 1972 and 2017. For each of their 3,200+ tenures, the
dataset lists the minister’s name, country, year-month started/ended,
gender, whether the minister received an advanced economics education,
and whether they’d be considered a technocrat — i.e., someone who had
policy expertise but hadn’t held elective office. [h/t <a

<p><strong>Netflix viewership.</strong> In late 2021, Netflix <a

publishing</a> downloadable datasets of <a
href="https://top10.netflix.com/">the 10 most popular movies and TV
shows each week</a>, overall and by country. Last week the company <a
href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-a-netflix-engagement-report">published
a new data report</a>, which lists all 18,000+ titles viewed for 50,000+
hours on the platform in the first half of 2023. The report, which
Netflix says it will publish twice a year, indicates each title’s name,
release date, approximate hours viewed, and whether it was available
globally. [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/Arithmomaniac">Avi Levin</a>

<p><strong>NYC shelter counts.</strong> Every night, tens of thousands
of people stay in New York City homeless shelters, which are managed by
a half-dozen city agencies. Earlier this year, <a
href="https://citylimits.org/2023/07/24/as-homeless-population-booms-nyc-steps-closer-to-an-accurate-shelter-census/">thanks
to a 2022 law</a>, the city began publishing <a
href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Local-Law-79-2022-Temporary-Housing-Assistance-Usa/jiwc-ncpi">monthly
statistics</a> on shelter population counts and average lengths of stay,
broken down by agency, program, and family composition. One agency, the
Department of Homeless Services, <a
href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/DHS-Daily-Report/k46n-sa2m">publishes
some structured daily data</a>, but shares its most comprehensive daily
counts as <a

nightly-overwritten PDF</a>. So <a
href="https://patrickspauster.com/">Patrick Spauster</a> and <a

to scrape, archive, and standardize these datasets, and have <a
href="https://citylimits.org/2023/12/07/tracking-nycs-record-high-homeless-shelter-population/">partnered
with City Limits</a> to revamp <a
href="https://citylimits.org/nyc-shelter-count/">the publication’s
shelter population tracker</a>. In October, more than 143,000 people
slept in the city’s shelters, the highest monthly count on record.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>US solar facilities.</strong> The <a
href="https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uspvdb/">United States Large-Scale Solar
Photovoltaic Database</a>, released last month, maps and describes
3,600+ solar power facilities with capacities of at least 1 megawatt.
The project, a collaboration between the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory and US Geological Survey, includes an <a
href="https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uspvdb/viewer/">online viewer</a>, <a
href="https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uspvdb/data/">downloadable database</a>,

coordinates, state, county, and site type, plus data extracted from <a

such as capacity, axis type, tilt angle, and more.

<p><strong>Trans rights.</strong> <a
href="https://www.myleswilliamson.net/">Myles Williamson</a>’s <a

Rights Indicator Project</a> “provides insight into the legal situations
transgender people faced in 173 countries from 2000 to 2021.” The <a
href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FXXLTS">project’s
dataset</a> is “the only public dataset covering trans rights with wide
spatial <em>and</em> temporal coverage (to my knowledge),” Williamson
writes. For each country-year combination, it “includes 14 indicators
that capture the presence or absence of laws related to criminalization,
legal gender recognition, and anti-discrimination protections.” <a

the country require a psychological diagnosis before someone can change
their gender on identity documents?</p>

<p><strong>Home schooling.</strong> The Washington Post has gathered <a
href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data_home_schooling">data on
home-school enrollment figures</a> in dozens of US states and 6,700+
school districts over the past six academic years. Post reporters, with
help from students at American University, “trawled state websites,
contacted education officials in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia and submitted multiple public records requests” to build the
dataset, <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2023/11/09/tracking-home-schooling-an-expansive-data-set-exclusively-washington-post/">released
last week</a>. Each entry <a
href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data_home_schooling/blob/main/home_school_data_dictionary.csv">indicates</a>
the state/district, school year, and the number of students registered
for home schooling. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/2023/homeschooling-growth-data-by-district/">The
Post’s analysis</a>, which “reveals that a dramatic rise in home
schooling at the onset of the pandemic has largely sustained itself
through the 2022-23 academic year, defying predictions […].” [h/t <a

<p><strong>Migrant arrivals in Italy.</strong> The <a

campaign’s latest initiative, <a
href="https://datibenecomune.substack.com/p/il-numero-zero"><em>Liberiamoli
tutti!</em></a> (<em>Let’s free them all!</em>), aims to improve the
availability of Italian government data. Its first project has been to
convert the <a
href="http://www.libertaciviliimmigrazione.dlci.interno.gov.it/it/documentazione/statistica/cruscotto-statistico-giornaliero">interior
ministry’s statistics on migrant arrivals</a> from PDF reports <a
href="https://github.com/ondata/liberiamoli-tutti/blob/main/sbarchi-migranti/dati/README.md">into
spreadsheets</a>. The extracted information <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dNlByw2cMoqGorp4zPN6OULtG_jVRCe5xpl0YdKJxFE/edit#gid=1693395128">includes</a>
daily counts of sea arrivals, twice-monthly totals by nationality, and
the number of people in <a

centers</a> by center type and Italian region. <strong>A nice

<p><strong>Toxic wastewater spills.</strong> For a <a

Inside Climate News investigation</a>, <a

Pskowski</a> and <a href="https://peteraldhous.com/">Peter Aldhous</a>
wrangled <a
href="https://github.com/InsideClimateNews/2023-10-tx-produced-water-spills">data
on 10,000+ wastewater spills</a> reported by oil and gas companies to
the Texas government between 2013 and 2022. These “spill logs” —
obtained through public records requests, then cleaned and standardized
by the journalists — correspond to <a
href="https://insideclimatenews.github.io/2023-10-tx-produced-water-spills/tx-spills-central.html">more
than 148 million gallons</a> of “produced water,” a byproduct of
drilling and fracking. The data indicate each spill’s date, location,
facility, operator, type of operation, volume of wastewater released,
volume recovered, and much more.</p>

blind-tasted the same four coffees. Hoffman has published a <a

results</a>, as well as a <a href="https://bit.ly/gacttCSV+">spreadsheet

tasters’ demographics, general coffee drinking habits and preferences,
assessments of the four coffees, and more. [h/t Dan Brady]</p>

href="https://www.opioidsettlementtracker.com/">OpioidSettlementTracker.com</a>,
<a href="https://www.opioidsettlementtracker.com/about">run by lawyer
Christine Minhee</a>, asks: “Will opioid settlements be spent in ways
that bolster the public health response to drug use?” Minhee has
compiled a series of spreadsheets to help answer that question. They
track the <a

“a new effort by the <a href="https://www.taxobservatory.eu/">EU Tax

<p><strong>Minority-serving colleges.</strong> The <a

either through their mission (e.g., <a

or through enrollment. The project examines institutions’ funding
status, location, student body, and degree granting for 2017–2021. It
draws on records from the Department of Education’s “<a

<p><strong>Childcare inspections.</strong> “Across 41 states, one in ten
licensed daycare facilities is overdue for an inspection,” according to
an <a
href="https://usafacts.org/data-projects/childcare-inspections">analysis
by USAFacts</a>, which gathered inspection-timing data for 148,000
facilities. The analysis’s downloadable datasets indicate the number of
facilities overdue (versus on-time or unknown) in each state and county,
as well as the distribution of days-since-last-inspection in each state.
Most of the inspection data had to be programmatically collected from
state portals, <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amberrthomas_are-states-meeting-their-childcare-inspection-activity-7120861735833518080-V-6s/">according

<p><strong>Two Zurich buses.</strong> <a

dataset</a> provides detailed data from 1,409 “driving missions” of two
electric public transit buses in Zurich, Switzerland. Each mission
typically represents a full day’s operation. The records, which span
early 2019 to late 2022, include “time series that represent the power
demand, propulsion system, odometry, global position, ambient
temperature, door openings, number of passengers, and the dispatch
patterns within the public transportation network of the two
vehicles.”</p>
