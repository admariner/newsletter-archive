<p> </p>
<p><strong>Historical newswire articles.</strong> <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09490">Emily Silcock et al.</a> have
created <a
href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/dell-research-harvard/newswire">Newswire</a>,
a dataset of 2.7 million newswire articles published in the US between
1878 and 1977. To build it, they extracted 138 million articles from
scans of newspapers’ front pages and then used machine learning to group
those coming “from the same underlying newswire source article, in the
presence of significant abridgement and noise.” For each detected
newswire item, the dataset lists the newspapers that carried it, dates
published, the text of a representative version, its extracted byline,
dispatch location, people mentioned in the text, general topic, and
more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Death penalty status by country.</strong> The <a

Death Penalty Database</a>, <a

by <a href="https://research.abo.fi/en/persons/carsten-anckar">Carsten
Anckar</a> and <a
href="https://www.oru.se/english/employee/thomas_denk">Thomas Denk</a>,
tracks the status of capital punishment in 206 independent countries
annually from 1800 to 2022. It places each observation into one of five
categories, indicating whether the death penalty is: (a) fully
abolished, (b) abolished “for ordinary crimes only,” (c) abolished for
“for ordinary crimes only but where at least one execution has occurred
in the last 10 years,” (d) <em>de facto</em> abolished, or (e) still in
use. <strong>Previously</strong>: The <a

<p><strong>Beach replenishment.</strong> The <a
href="https://psds.wcu.edu/">Program for the Study of Developed
Shorelines</a> at Western Carolina University maintains a <a
href="https://beachnourishment.wcu.edu/">database of 2,500+
beach-replenishing efforts</a> since the 1920s. The <a
href="https://beachnourishment.wcu.edu/about">project</a> is “a 25-year
research and data collection effort that, to the best of our knowledge,
represents the most comprehensive compilation of beach nourishment
history in the United States.” For each sand-adding “episode,” the
dataset <a
href="https://beachnourishment.wcu.edu/glossary">indicates</a> its
location, year completed, sand volume, length of shoreline treated,
total cost, primary type of funding source (private, federal, state,
etc.), and justification (shore protection, navigation, emergency dune
construction, etc.). <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

CBS News Investigations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hurricane forecast accuracy.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/">National Hurricane Center</a> says it
“receives frequent inquiries on the accuracy and skill of its forecasts
and of the computer models available to it.” To help answer those
questions, the agency publishes a <a
href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/index.shtml">series of
regularly-updated verification reports</a>, as well as a <a
href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify7.shtml">database
quantifying its forecast errors</a>. For each official projection since
1970, the database <a
href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify2.shtml">compares</a>
each storm’s predicted location and wind speed to those attributes’
ultimate values. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a

Hurricane Forecasts</a>,” a study by <a

<p><strong>UK film stats.</strong> The British Film Institute publishes
a <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/industry-data-insights">variety of
statistical reports</a>, including <a

of weekend box office figures</a>. Those spreadsheets cover each
weekend’s 15 highest-grossing films, all UK-originated films, and other
newly-released films; they list each film’s title, country of origin,
distributor, cinema count, weekend gross, total gross to date, and more.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Supreme gifts.</strong> <a
href="https://fixthecourt.com/about-us/">Fix the Court</a> is a
nonprofit that “advocates for non-ideological ‘fixes’ that would make
the federal courts, and primarily the U.S. Supreme Court, more open and
more accountable to the American people.” Earlier this month, they <a
href="https://fixthecourt.com/2024/06/a-staggering-tally-supreme-court-justices-accepted-hundreds-of-gifts-worth-millions-of-dollars/">published</a>
a <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14l25NLvBOd9sk4mArK4k7dtV0MUwxr5GBuLHL5Sp8lo/edit">series
of spreadsheets</a> tallying 500+ gifts accepted by the Supreme Court’s
justices since 2000, with an estimated total value of $4.76 million. The
findings “are largely based on last year’s groundbreaking work by
ProPublica and includes data from stories in the New York Times, L.A.
Times, the congressional record, annual disclosures,” and Fix the
Court’s own work. The data indicate each gift’s year, recipient,
description, giver, value, and the source of information.

2019.04.24</a>), “aims to answer some of the most important questions
surrounding interactions between the internet and politics.” To do so,
they conduct surveys of experts and ask them <a
href="https://digitalsocietyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSP-Codebook-v6.pdf">questions
such as</a>: “How often does the government shut down domestic access to
the Internet?” and “How often do domestic elites use social media to
organize offline political action of any kind?” The survey’s <a
href="https://digitalsocietyproject.org/data/">downloadable datasets</a>
cover 170+ countries and provide aggregate metrics for each question.

<p><strong>Interest group positions.</strong> <a

of “over 13 million policy positions stated by tens of thousands of
interest groups and individuals on bills in 17 state legislatures over
the past 25 years.” The authors collected and standardized the data,
which span 1997 to 2022, from lobbying and testimony disclosures. For
each of those positions, the dataset indicates the relevant bill, client
or individual represented, representative name, position phrase
(<em>for</em>, <em>against</em>, <em>monitoring</em>,
<em>undecided</em>, etc.), the date the position was reported, and <a

Summary of State and Local Government Tax Revenue</a> provides these
figures every three months, going back decades. The categories include
taxes on property, income, general sales, sales of specific products
(such as tobacco, alcohol, gas, and gambling), licenses, and more. For

<p><strong>NYC shelter exits.</strong> A 2022 law requires New York City

<p><strong>Unaccompanied migrant children.</strong> The New York Times’
<a href="https://www.hannahdreier.com/">Hannah Dreier</a> was <a

a Pulitzer Prize last week</a> for a “series of stories revealing the
stunning reach of migrant child labor across the United States—and the

has noted</a>, was partly driven by <a

obtained from the Department of Health and Human Services</a> via a FOIA
request and lawsuit. The dataset, published in December <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/28/us/migrants-children-data.html">along
with visualizations</a>, describes the placement of 550,000+
unaccompanied migrant children with local sponsors between January 2015
and May 2023: each child’s country of origin, gender, date of entry, and
date of release to a sponsor, plus the sponsor’s ZIP code and

<p><strong>Public procurement.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340924003810">Global
Public Procurement Dataset</a> provides standardized data on 72 million
government contracts in 42 countries. The dataset, constructed from
official sources by the Budapest-based <a
href="https://www.govtransparency.eu/">Government Transparency
Institute</a>, represents $17 trillion in total procurement. It begins
in the 2000s for most of the countries and concludes in 2021. For each
contract, it provides information about the tender (title, procedure
type, product code, publication date, award date, final price, currency,
etc.), government buyer, bidders’ names and locations, and more. The
downloadable files are split into <a

lithium and 29 <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/pfas-explained">per-

<p><strong>Groundwater wells.</strong> Despite the infrastructural
importance of groundwater wells, “a unified database collecting and
standardizing information on the characteristics and locations of these
wells across the United States has been lacking,” <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03186-3">Chung-Yi Lin
et al.</a> write. “To bridge this gap, we have created a comprehensive
database of groundwater well records collected from state and federal
agencies.” Their <a
href="https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/8b02895f02c14dd1a749bcc5584a5c55/">United
States Groundwater Well Database</a> contains ~14 million records, each
indicating a well equipped for monitoring or extracting water. Where
available, each row lists the well’s coordinates, county, aquifer,
watershed, depth, capacity, water use category, water potability, and
more. [h/t <a href="http://knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/">Derek M. Jones</a>]</p>

Work-Injury Policy Database</a> tracks the history of work-injury laws
(also known as workers’ compensation laws) in 186 “independent nation
states.” For each, the database lists the year of its first such law,
the year a law first provided insurance for work-related injuries, the
type of program it established, and more. It also incorporates data on
current laws’ coverage and payment rates from <a

<p><strong>Colonial empire timelines.</strong> The <a

Dates Dataset</a>, <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/apvqm">compiled
by</a> political scientist <a
href="https://www.beckerbastian.net/">Bastian Becker</a>, “aggregates
information on the reach and duration of European colonial empires from
renowned secondary sources.” Producing the dataset from its four main
sources “is largely automated, relying on predefined coding rules.” The
dataset indicates the first and last years each contemporary country was
colonized, disaggregated by eight colonizing countries (Belgium,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain). [h/t

<p><strong>Things flung spaceward.</strong> The UN’s <a

Affairs</a> maintains an <a
href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/osoindex/search-ng.jspx">Online Index
of Objects Launched into Outer Space</a>, based on a <a
href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/spaceobjectregister/index.html">similarly-named
register</a>, itself mandated by a <a

convention</a>, which <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registration_Convention">went into
force in 1976</a>. Presented as an HTML table, the index lists 17,000+
satellites, spacecraft, probes, and other objects’ names, launching
countries, statuses, launch dates, and more. <strong>As seen
