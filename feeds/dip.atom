<p> </p>
<p><strong>Redistricting.</strong> US <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting">decennial redistricting</a> is well underway, with redrawn legislative maps approved in the majority of states. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/">FiveThirtyEight</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2022/congressional-redistricting-maps-by-state-and-district/">Politico</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/redistricting-tracker-map/">The Washington Post</a> have all built graphics tracking the process and its likely effects on Congress. The <a href="https://redistrictingdatahub.org/">Redistricting Data Hub</a>, a project of the <a href="https://redistrictingdatahub.org/about/about-us/#whoweare">Fair Representation in Redistricting Initiative</a>, has been gathering states’ proposed and approved maps (e.g., <a href="https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/2021-california-congressional-districts-approved-plan/">California’s</a>, from <a href="https://www.wedrawthelinesca.org/final_maps">its commission</a>), as well <a href="https://redistrictingdatahub.org/data/about-our-data/">other datasets useful for analyzing the changes</a>. <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/">All About Redistricting</a>, a resource founded by Loyola Law School’s <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/about/my-work/">Justin Levitt</a>, also publishes <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/mapdownload/?sortby=-updated&amp;page=1">state mapping data</a>, as well as a downloadable table describing <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/national-overview/?colorby=Institution&amp;level=Congress&amp;cycle=2020">who controls each state’s redistricting process</a>.</p>

<p><strong>SARS-CoV-2 in local sewage.</strong> <a href="https://biobot.io/">Biobot Analytics</a>, a wastewater epidemiology company, has been partnering with local governments to monitor sewage for traces of coronavirus. Their <a href="https://biobot.io/data/">public dashboard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/biobotanalytics/covid19-wastewater-data">downloadable data</a> provide weekly estimates of the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per milliliter of wastewater — at a national and regional level, and for 31 of the participating communities (some with data more recent than others). <strong>Read more</strong>: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/health/covid-omicron-wastewater-sewage.html">In Sewage, Clues to Omicron’s Surge</a>” (The New York Times).

The spreadsheets, which go back to 2015, list the employer and union’s name and location, their industry, the size of the bargaining unit, and a few other details. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/reports/graphs-data/recent-election-results">Union elections</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-05-05-edition/">DIP 2021.05.05</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/labordata/nlrb-voluntary-recognitions">voluntary recognition</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-09-22-edition/">DIP 2021.09.22</a>).

    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Political emails, foreign commerce interventions, commuting zones, tech support scams, and Wordle words.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>More political emails.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/derekwillis">Derek Willis</a>, a <a href="https://merrill.umd.edu/directory/derek-willis">journalism lecturer</a> with an expertise in political data, <a href="https://createsend.com/t/t-97F63A7D578A8F0B2540EF23F30FEDED">has published</a> a searchable, downloadable <a href="https://political-emails.herokuapp.com/">database of 100,000+ email messages</a> received in recent years by an address he created for this purpose, and “which I routinely plug into forms I find on candidate and committee sites.” The database, which Willis <a href="https://twitter.com/derekwillis/status/1480657382703312901">plans to update weekly</a>, lists each message’s timestamp, sender, subject line, and body. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://electionemails2020.org/">The Princeton Corpus of Political Emails</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-06-23-edition/">DIP 2021.06.23</a>), <a href="https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-wheres-my-email">the Markup’s collection of 5,000+ campaign emails</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-03-04-edition/">DIP 2020.03.04</a>, and <a href="https://www.dcinbox.com/">DCInbox’s congressional e-newsletter collection</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-03-03-edition/">DIP 2021.03.03</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Foreign commerce interventions.</strong> The <a href="https://www.globaltradealert.org/">Global Trade Alert</a>, <a href="https://www.globaltradealert.org/about">launched in 2009</a>, “provides timely information on state interventions taken since November 2008 that are likely to affect foreign commerce,” such as new subsidies, export quotas, import tariffs, or anti-dumping laws. Its <a href="https://www.globaltradealert.org/data_extraction">downloadable dataset</a> describes 33,000+ interventions, listing their types, implementing jurisdictions, affected jurisdictions, affected products, and more. The project, <a href="https://www.unisg.ch/en/wissen/newsroom/aktuell/rssnews/forschung-lehre/2020/november/stgallen-endowment-for-prosperity-through-trade-26november2020">affiliated with the University of St. Gallen</a>, has also started tracking <a href="https://www.globaltradealert.org/digital_policy">interventions that affect digital commerce</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Commuting zones.</strong> Decades ago, the USDA <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/">Economic Research Service</a> developed a methodology to group the nation’s counties into hundreds of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting_zone">commuting zones</a>,” based on the Census’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/commuting.html">journey to work</a> data. Those groupings are available <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commuting-zones-and-labor-market-areas/">from the agency</a> (for 1980, 1990, and 2000), and <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/psucz/">from researchers at Penn State</a> (for those years plus 2010). More recently, Facebook/Meta <a href="https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/commuting-zones">has developed</a> its <a href="https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/docs/methodology-commuting-zones">own methodology</a> for estimating commuting zones, using location data collected from its users. The project’s <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/commuting-zones">public dataset</a> spans the world and specifies the zones not as sets of counties but as detailed, custom boundaries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tech support scams.</strong> From 2018 to 2021, the now-shuttered <a href="https://github.com/choozn/PopupDB-Data/">PopupDB Project</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210307114123/https://popupdb.org/">collected</a> information about <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-tech-support-scams">tech support scams</a> and their deceptive browser popups. Its maintainers have since released two final downloads: a “<a href="https://github.com/choozn/PopupDB-Data/tree/main/databases">light</a>” dataset that lists the URLs and web hosts of 11,000+ such popups, and a “<a href="https://popupdb.org/downloads">full</a>” database that includes screenshots and source code.

    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Slaveholders in Congress, pension plans, journal editors, radio on the internet, and chocolate bar reviews.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>👋 Some updates: After nearly eight (very fulfilling) years as BuzzFeed News’ data editor, I’m shifting roles there — I’ll be working part-time (for now) on a new initiative that I’m quite excited about. More details on that soonish. In the meantime, two related developments: ✨ <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/buzzfeed/jobs/3758781?gh_jid=3758781">we’re hiring a new data editor</a> ✨ (ask me about it!) and I’ve added a ✨ <a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/jobs">job board</a> ✨ to Data Is Plural (see below).</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Slaveholders in Congress.</strong> At least “1,715 members of Congress were enslavers at some point in their adult lives,” according to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/congress-slaveowners-names-list/">Washington Post investigation published Monday</a>. Reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/juliezweil">Julie Zauzmer Weil</a> began her research with a list of <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators">every person who ever served in the House or Senate</a>, filtered it to those born before 1840, and then consulted <a href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/">their biographies</a>, Census records, and other historical documents. The Post’s <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-congress-slaveowners/">public dataset</a>, the first of its kind, lists the congressmen from that era, their dates of birth, positions held in Congress, states served, dates served, and whether the Post determined they were slaveholders. For 677 of the congressmen, the Post “couldn’t reach a conclusion” and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/submit-congress-enslaved-database/">is seeking assistance from readers</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pension plans.</strong> <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/">Public Plans Data</a>, a <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/about/our-research">collaboration</a> led by Boston College professor <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/about/bios/munnell/">Alicia H. Munnell</a>, gathers extensive information about the retirement plans that state and local governments offer their employees, drawn from <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/resources/download-avs-cafrs/">those plans’ annual financial reports</a>. The project maintains a <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/public-plans-database/download-full-data-set/">range of datasets</a>, including two decades of participation and financial figures for 200+ plans that account for “95 percent of public pension membership and assets nationwide,” their investments, early payout options, and more. It also provides <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/resources/interactive-tools/">interactive tools</a> and <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/public-plans-database/api/">an API</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Journal editors.</strong> For his <a href="https://openeditors.ooir.org/">Open Editors</a> project, <a href="https://twitter.com/andrepacher">Andreas Nishikawa-Pacher</a> scrapes the websites of scholarly journals, extracting the names, affiliations, and roles of their listed editors and board members. The <a href="https://github.com/andreaspacher/openeditors">project’s dataset</a> contains half a million associations between editors and 6,000+ scholarly journals from 22 publishers (17 mainstream and 5 “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_publishing">predatory</a>”). <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jvzq7/">Nishikawa-Pacher et al.’s introductory working paper</a>. <strong>And</strong>: “<a href="https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/researchers-created-database-half-million-journal-open-editors">Why researchers created a database of half a million journal editors</a>” (Nature Index, 2021).</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Civil asset forfeiture.</strong> “Most states and the federal government have laws allowing police and prosecutors to seize and permanently keep Americans’ cash, cars, homes and other property suspected of being involved in a crime — without regard to the owners’ guilt or innocence,” the nonprofit law firm <a href="https://ij.org/about-us/">Institute for Justice</a> writes in its <a href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/">third edition of <em>Policing for Profit</em></a>, published in 2020. The report gathers and analyzes <a href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/policing-for-profit-data/">datasets on property seized in dozens of states</a> through this practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States">civil asset forfeiture</a>, and on the spending of forfeiture funds. It also examines seizures from the federal <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jmd/major-information-systems-consolidated-asset-tracking-system">Consolidated Asset Tracking System</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/afp/freedom-information-act">detailed public extracts</a> of which the Department of Justice updates quarterly. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://thewhyaxis.substack.com/p/cops-still-take-more-stuff-from-people">Cops still take more stuff from people than burglars do</a>” (The Why Axis, 2021), and “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2014/09/06/stop-and-seize/">Stop and Seize</a>” (Washington Post, 2014).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Joint military exercises.</strong> Jordan Bernhardt’s <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HXQFHU">Joint Military Exercises Dataset</a> describes 5,000+ such operations undertaken between 1977 and 2016, drawn from historical news reports. The dataset lists each exercise’s name, location, when it began and ended, the countries that participated, activities involved, and more. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.brandonkinne.com/">Brandon J. Kinne</a>’s <a href="https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/defense-cooperation-agreement-dataset">Defense Cooperation Agreement Dataset</a>, a “comprehensive, human-coded dataset” covering bilateral defense treaties between 1980 and 2010.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Medical drug names.</strong> To build their <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9nmgzttxhm/1">International Drug Dictionary</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921009768">Mohammad A. Khaleel et al.</a> collected trade names and ingredient names “from open access websites belonging to official drug regulatory agencies, official healthcare systems, or recognized scientific bodies from 44 countries around the world,” among other sources. Each of the 450,000+ entries maps a name to standardized ingredient information from the National Library of Medicine’s <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html">RxNorm</a> database.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Foundation shades.</strong> For “<a href="https://pudding.cool/2021/03/foundation-names/">The Naked Truth</a>,” a Pudding article published last year with <a href="https://ofunneamaka.com/about-ofunneamaka/">Ofunne Amaka</a>, <a href="https://amber.rbind.io/">Amber Thomas</a> scraped <a href="https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/foundation-names">information about 6,800+ foundation shades</a> from the websites of two major cosmetics retailers.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Local mortality and the 1918 pandemic.</strong> <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zf6wy/">Martin Eiermann, Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, et al.</a> have conducted an analysis of deaths before, during, and after the 1918 influenza pandemic, drawing on “data from multiple sources, including digitized mortality records for 70 U.S. cities, linked census records that establish urban residency status across multiple censuses” and newspaper accounts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-pharmaceutical_intervention_(epidemiology)">non-pharmaceutical interventions</a>. The team’s <a href="https://osf.io/njghd/">published files</a> includes a dataset that, for each city-and-year, lists the mortality rate overall, for white vs. non-white residents, and due to flu/pneumonia; a range of demographic variables; the timing of certain interventions; and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Religious congregations.</strong> The <a href="https://www.thearda.com/">Association of Religion Data Archives</a>, founded in 1997, “strives to democratize access to the best data on religion.” Among <a href="https://www.thearda.com/Archive/browse.asp">its resources</a> are <a href="https://www.thearda.com/Archive/NCS.asp">four waves of the National Congregations Study</a>, a <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/ncsweb/">Duke University–based survey</a> that <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/ncsweb/methodology/">asks US religious establishments</a> about their denominational affiliation, buildings of worship, congregants, staffing, educational offerings, and more. Representatives from 5,300+ Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, and other congregations participated in the latest wave, conducted in 2018–19.

<p><strong>Language from 100 million academic articles.</strong> <a href="https://archive.org/details/GeneralIndex">The General Index</a>, a new project from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Malamud">Carl Malamud</a>’s <a href="https://public.resource.org/">Public Resource</a>, contains detailed linguistic data derived from 107,233,728 academic journal articles. The index’s main table contains all one-to-five-word sequences found in each article, and their frequencies — more than 355 billion “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">n-grams</a>” in total. A second table identifies nearly 20 billion keywords <a href="https://pypi.org/project/yake/">auto-extracted</a> from the corpus, and a third table lists the authors, title, publication date, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOI</a> associated with each article. <strong>Read more</strong>: “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02142-1">The plan to mine the world’s research papers</a>” (Nature, July 2019) and “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02895-8">Giant, free index to world’s research papers released online</a>” (Nature, October 2021).

<p><strong>Personal income.</strong> The US Bureau of Economic Analysis <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/personal-income-county-and-metropolitan-area-2020">has released</a> its latest <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income-county-metro-and-other-areas">county-level estimates of personal income</a>, which now cover 1969–2020. The per-capita numbers are also available by <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/about.html">metropolitan statistical area</a>, as well as disaggregated by income “component” (wages/salaries, income from assets, etc.) and industry. You can <a href="https://apps.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm">download the data</a> and also explore it through interactive <a href="https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&amp;step=1&amp;acrdn=6">tables</a> and <a href="https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=99&amp;step=1&amp;acrdn=7">maps</a>. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://inclusivewealth.eig.org/wealthmap/">From Wealthy Enclaves to Asset Deserts</a>,” a map and report by the <a href="https://eig.org/about-us">Economic Innovation Group</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Banking-crisis interventions.</strong> Economists <a href="https://faculty.som.yale.edu/andrewmetrick/">Andrew Metrick</a> and <a href="https://www.pfschmelzing.me/">Paul Schmelzing</a> have <a href="https://som.yale.edu/faculty-research-centers/centers-initiatives/program-on-financial-stability/metrick-schmelzing-paper-and-database">compiled a database</a> of 800+ banking crises spanning the years 1257 to 2019, plus 1,800+ government attempts to mitigate them. For each crisis, the database provides the starting year, relevant country or region, a brief description, and more. It also describes the interventions, lists their dates, classifies them into 20 categories (asset guarantees, market liquidity assistance, etc.), and links them to sources and prior literature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Europe’s primary forests.</strong> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00988-7">Francesco Maria Sabatini et al.</a> have combined information from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00988-7/tables/4">dozens of sources</a> to develop “the most comprehensive dataset” of Europe’s “primary forests” — those “where the signs of human impacts, if any, are strongly blurred due to decades without forest management.” The <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/European_Primary_Forest_Database/13194095/2">dataset</a>, which includes 18,411 patches across 33 countries, describes their names, locations, level of “naturalness,” dominant tree species, and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2016123">EU-Forest</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-01-25-edition/">DIP 2017.01.25</a>).</p>

    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Carbon credits, foodborne pathogens, violence against environmental defenders, mineral production, and Werner’s Nomenclature of Colours.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Carbon credits.</strong> The <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/faculty-and-impact/centers/cepp/projects/berkeley-carbon-trading-project/offsets-database">Voluntary Registry Offsets Database</a>, a collaboration between the <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/faculty-and-impact/centers/cepp/projects/berkeley-carbon-trading-project">Berkeley Carbon Trading Project</a> and <a href="https://carbon-direct.com/">Carbon Direct</a>, “contains all carbon offset projects, credit issuances, and credit retirements listed globally by four major voluntary offset project registries,” accounting for “almost all of the world’s voluntary market offsets.” Updated in September with data through early May 2021, the database covers 5,000+ projects and 1.2 billion credits issued. Each credit purportedly offsets a metric tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but the Berkeley team is skeptical: “Research performed by us and others has found that many, if not most, offset credits traded on the market today do not represent real emissions reductions.” <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/map_data">The World Bank’s database of carbon pricing initiatives</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Foodborne pathogens.</strong> In an <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-propublica-used-genomic-sequencing-data-to-track-an-ongoing-salmonella-outbreak">explainer article</a> accompanying a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/salmonella-chicken-usda-food-safety">recent food-safety investigation</a>, ProPublica reporter <a href="https://www.propublica.org/people/irena-hwang">Irena Hwang</a> describes using her training in bioinformatics to analyze salmonella DNA data collected by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a>’s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/">Pathogen Detection</a> initiative, which <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/faq/">aggregates genomic sequences</a> from bacteria “originating in food, environmental sources, and patients.” The initiative has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/pathogens_help/#data-retrieval">published such data</a> for nearly 1 million samples of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/organisms/">dozens of species</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/chicken/">ProPublica’s Chicken Checker lookup tool</a>, based on the <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/science-data/data-sets-visualizations/laboratory-sampling-data">results of Department of Agriculture microbiological sampling</a> conducted at processing plants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Violence against environmental defenders.</strong> <a href="https://tierraderesistentes.com/en/">Tierra de Resistentes</a> is a “crossborder journalistic effort to investigate episodes of violence against leaders and communities in Latin America who have devoted their lives to defending the environment.” The <a href="https://tierraderesistentes.com/es/datos/">collaboration’s database</a> details 2,400+ such attacks, mostly focusing on the years 2009–2019. For each attack, it provides information about the person, organization, or community attacked, the type of violence, the resource defended, case status, and more.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mineral production.</strong> The US Geological Survey’s <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic">National Minerals Information Center</a> keeps tabs on “minerals and materials essential to the U.S. economy, the national security, and protection of the environment.” Its published datasets include annual statistics on <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic/state-minerals-statistics-and-information">mineral production by state</a>, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic/international-minerals-statistics-and-information">by country</a>, and <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic/commodity-statistics-and-information">by commodity</a>.

<p><strong>Werner’s Nomenclature of Colours.</strong> Data artist <a href="https://www.c82.net/">Nicholas Rougeux</a> has <a href="https://www.c82.net/werner/">digitally recreated</a> Scottish painter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Syme">Patrick Syme</a>’s 1821 <a href="https://archive.org/details/gri_c00033125012743312">guidebook</a> to German mineralogist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Gottlob_Werner">Abraham Werner</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner%27s_Nomenclature_of_Colours">color system</a>. For each of the 110 colors, such as <em>Saffron Yellow</em> and <em>Veinous Blood Red</em>, a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10w7UebIDqN6ChEpBwLDQmAgVZZhLtKvnrLeNnBjJmsc/edit">corresponding spreadsheet</a> contains its name, hex code, description, and more.
